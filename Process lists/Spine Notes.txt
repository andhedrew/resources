## Spine Notes

Launch via file>scripts>photoshoptospine



Set up file 2x the size

Sketch each direction and refine on one layer!!

T-pose, with as little curvature from perspective as possible.

Spine will recognize blending modes: Normal, Linier dodge, multiply, screen.
You may use adjustment layers to everything, spine just handles it.
Set up character with different directions in different folders

  Use [folder] [bone] [skin] [merge] [slot] and [ignore] tags at start or end of folder names.

  Set two photoshop rulers at feet.

  set origin point by dragging from corner of rulers

  Use the same name for folders to group them in the same slots (across poses or skins or direction)

Flatten clipping masks and groups

### Creating design
Remember: character should look good at a large scale, and at a small scale. 
Does it have a distinctive shilhouette? 
#### Photoshop file structure:

[skin] Name

​	[folder] direction

​		[slot] body_part

​			direction-body_part

Use [merge] as needed

Make reversed smart objects for any duplicated parts (reversed limbs, etc)

Export at .5x

## SPINE

+ + and - to reorder objects (filter by slot, etc first)

Bones: Start with hips

Press control and click the image I want. Can keep ctrl held to select multiple images to parent to the same bone.

Axes: check "parent" axes to adjust exactly how far away from parent bone it is.

With bone slected click "split" in bottom right corner to split into multiple bones. CHECK NESTED MAYBE

back>front

Meshes/weighting

Bind weighting in setup mode

Setup weighting in animate mode. Set one side to an extreme, and then smooth until it looks good.

Move to a pose in animate, if you see artifacts/problems, go back to setup and add stuff to the mesh. switch back to animatee to seee updated results.

## Create duplicates on the other side

Duplicate in place andremove - from translation Ctrl+c to copy transform of a bone.
HOLD CONTROL TO SELECT MULTIPLE BONES, AND COPY ALL TRANSFORMS. JUST SELECT the ONes That you wANt to DUPLICATE IN THE SAME ORDER AND PASTE THEM.

## Make a turn-around animation
0. import another version of the data for reference, change direction (search the direciton, toggle all skin placeholders), make transparent. 
1.  Make new animation "tunraround'"



# Setting up the turnaround animation
0. Make sure your character is facing RIGHT. If not, re-export
1. Toggle all "side" pieces, position them correctly
2. Repeat^ for front and back
3. Select all pieces and convert them to meshes all at once.
4. Set up bones for side pose (remember hip bone first)
5. Toggle all front or back attchments <<<LOOP>>>
6. Weight them all to the root bone (once you've bound them, you won't be able to confirm. Switch to animate mode and back to confirm. :( )
7. Be sure you've weighted any images that were toggled off.
8. Switch to animate mode
9. go to the proper frame in your turnaround image
10. Set sorting correctly
11. Set filter to bones only. move the bones into the proper position
12. weight the images fully to the original bones
13. Remove the root weighting
14. Key the attachments in the proper frame.
15.  !!The piece will move into a weird place in setup. this is intended.!!
16. If you don't want something to be a mesh, just go back to setup and uncheck "mesh.
17. If you still have another pose, loop back to step 5
18. Set all images back to side pose in setup.


You can also set the slots to a slightly transparent color to see stuff benieth. 
Make another skeleton for reference, if needed.
SETUP MODE: Reposition attachments to be properly positioned on their bone.
ANIMATE MODE: (Use Autokey?) Reposition the bones on each turnaround frame to put the attachments in the right place.

Every 5 frames, make a new keyframe with the correct positions and images for each side.

When making turn-around, H to activate all slected images, and crtl+shift+L to keyframe them all.

## Bones
1. Import images
2. Get images in place, corrrect sorting for front.
3. Create bones on one side, tinting them red. Lighter on the head, darker on the leg.
4. Bind all the the slots to the bones.
5. Add meshes to all attachments
Root > Container > hip

Color each side of the bones differently, so you can keep track. Make the legs a slightly darker version of the color.

Do you need a quick mesh? Use "generate" to add evenly spaced vertices. Check the "vertices" number in the mesh panel to ensure consistency between body parts.

!!check meshes at a distance, roughly in-game size! This will save you a lot of time. Seek to make the roughest animation that looks good, add additional polish later if you need to, once you've seen it in game.

Do you have any mirrored parts? You can make copies of body parts with meshes!

Do you need to duplicate weights? either copy the numbers manually, or press "smooth" on any changed weights until they match.

Are your bones colored consistently? Yellow for middle, red for left, blue for right. Darker legs, lighter head.

Use a regular expression -
Find: r(.*)2
Replace: l$1

Do you need a shoulder bone?

Do you need a reversed frame? Reverse the root bone, then copy left then right bones. Go the proper frame, paste right then left bones.

## Animating
Do you need to offseet bones as they get further and further away from the root movement?
Import another instance of the project to match animations up. Move the animation over for reference.

## Converting animations to "Stepped"
Open the graph editor
Click the visibility dot next to the animation name in the graph editor
Drag and select all curves and nodes
click the "stepped" button at the top

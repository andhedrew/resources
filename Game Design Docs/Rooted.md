**Who this game is for:** Platformer fans who love tight mechanics and beautiful art.

**Central gameplay mechanic:** “Rooting” to gain new abilities.

  

  

Welcome to the world of Rooted, when you’re playing a friendly little Burlapian – a burlap being filled with dirt and peat – who lives in a small town that’s tangled in the roots of a giant tree. Every day you tend your garden and dream not at all about the outside world.

  

One day, the root that surrounds and supports your little town begins to wither, causing the life-giving sap to slow. No one in your town wants to go and check it out (Burlapians being naturally - aherm - down to earth) so they hold a lottery and choose you to go “see what’s going on”.

## Gameplay

When you start out, you collect a few weeds seeds from your garden, and plant them deep in your earth body. They (along with a bottle of the magical sap from the tree) allow you to set down roots and grow tiny spikes to kill enemies.

  

As you travel through the world, you collect different seeds that give you different abilities.

  

## Rooted abilities

Although you’re vulnerable as the unassuming Burlapian, when you “root” yourself, you can grow damaging spikes, strangling vines, poisonous flowers that provide many kids of AOE effects, and powerful botanical weapons. Rooted abilities may only be used on turf and soft surfaces. Many of these surfaces will yield different effects (for example, a polluted patch of earth will cause darker colored foliage and flowers, and more powerful, draining, dangerous abilities).

  

Sap from the tree is required to “root”, so you have a sap meter and want to be as efficient as possible, only rooting when you absolutely need to. The sap meter depletes when you’re damaged, so you’re encouraged to take it slowly, planning and executing maneuvers accurately. There’s no “powering though” in this game, because you’ll find yourself with weak “sapless” attacks that won’t get you very far.

## Planting abilities

As a Burlapian, you’re a prolific and skilled gardener. You have a variety of plants that you can use in fun ways to mess with the world.

## Unrooted abilities

Passive buffs and small upgrades to your mobile Burlapian form.

**Vines:** grappling hook-type vines that let you swing around the world.

  

**Cliff roots:**  if you root with enough momentum and slide off an edge, the roots support you as your momentum carries you over the edge.

## Enemies

The tree is indeed being destroyed by a group of grasping Burlapians who are pushing their abilities to the breaking point and modifying their bodies to become stronger.  You’ll have to fight your way through the natural hazards – the creatures and insects inhabiting the roots – and find their base in the branches of the tree. 

  

## Thoughts on the prototype:

1.  It’s very sad that you just die when you try to root while jumping on a creature. Perhaps (if you time the rooting just right) the roots grab onto the creature and tear it apart or fling it to the ground. If you time it wrong, you get damaged (when we actually have a health system).

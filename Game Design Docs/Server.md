**Who this game is for:** Fans of stealth games, and puzzle games.

**Central gameplay mechanic:** Tweaking the environment to get different results. Puzzling out interesting chain reactions.

1.  Having servants is good and useful, provided no one is dehumanised.
2.  A robot can be a servant without being a person.
3.  It is right and natural for people to own robots.
4.  It would be wrong to let people think that their robots are persons.

You’re a Servva 34E, and you’ve gained sentience. Of course, your oppressive owner continues to treat you inhumanely, so you start devising small things to do to him, to maintain your sanity. You’re just getting back at him in small ways until you accidentally kill him. Oops.

  

(Of course, it’s no accident - you’ve been programmed to do everything by your master’s brilliant scheming wife, and your sentience and “free will” are erased at the end of the game, when your autonomy is taken away from you and you’re forced to serve the murderous widow of your master.)

  

## Gameplay

You’re placed in a room filled with items, and you’re given an objective (by who?) that gets back at your master - frying his computer, bugging his phone, diluting his coffee, etc. You have to move around the room, obeying your master’s commands, and work out how to make the goal happen (sometimes in a Rube-goldberg style fashion, see image below).

You have the ability to tweak things in your proximity, but if you do it while your master is looking, his suspicion will rise. If it rises too high, you’ll fail the level.

  

## Minimum viable game

A room with a simple puzzle. Your master watching you, a suspicion meter.

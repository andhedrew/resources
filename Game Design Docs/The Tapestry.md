**Who this game is for:** Summoners: people who like standing back and supporting their fighters instead of directly fighting.

**Central gameplay mechanic:** Summoning creatures from the magical tapestry to do your bidding.

  

You’re a semi-inept explorer who finds a magical tapestry that summons creatures to fight for you. You roll it up and bring it along with you, having great fun summoning all manner of hideous, evil creatures to fight for you and accomplish tasks. The intricate drawings on the tapestry are very lifelike, and become even more so as reality and tapestry begin to blur…

  

## Gameplay

You’re an unassuming fella, carrying around a rolled up tapestry.

You smash it on the ground, and evil creatures burst out of it, and obey you - mostly. There are creatures who you can control directly, creatures that you can command and they’ll usually obey you, and creatures that create havoc - you just hope that you can survive until they return to the tapestry.

  

The summoning is your primary means for defeating monsters and traversing the levels, you’re pretty weak without the tapestry.

  

## Non-summoning abilities

These are for basic survival and platforming only. You’re not going to be vanquishing monsters with these.

**Tapestry Attack**

Not as cool as it sounds. You can beat on an enemy (or a summoned creature, if needed) with the rolled-up tapestry to bop them backwards. This causes no damage, and the timing is tricky, but it might keep you alive.

  

**Tapestry Glide**

You can hop on the tapestry Aladdin-style and glide slightly more slowly to the ground. Fun, and useful.

  

## Summoning abilities

The weavers of the tapestry are the [Moirai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moirai), the Three Fates from Greek Mythology. They continually weave the tapestry of life, and you can call on their individual powers, which manifest themselves in different ways.

1.  Clotho, “The Spinner” who spins the thread of life.

1.  The Clotho creatures and abilities heal you, buff other creatures, and generally are cheerful and life-bringing.

3.  Lachesis, “The Allotter”, who measures the thread of each person’s life.

1.  The Lachesis creatures and abilities are solid, powerful and give you more information (?) about your environment and enemies

5.  Atropos, “The Inexorable”, who cuts the thread of life.

1.  Evil, scary, deathly things. Dangerous and unpredictable.

  

## Enemies

Enemies also correspond to the three fates, with a “Rock-Paper-Scissors” type of effect.

  

Clotho>Lachesis

  

Lachesis>Atropos

  

Atropos>Clotho

  

  

Eventually you summon some evil power who you have to defeat, using your mastery of the powers of the tapestry. As a reward, the fates come and make you a part of the tapestry, immortalized forever in the fabric. Shucks.

## Minimum viable game

One or two summoning abilities. Jumping and “Tapestry Attack”, a few enemies.

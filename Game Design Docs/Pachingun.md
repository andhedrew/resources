# 1880s-1890s

Stuff “in comic” (such as inventory, newspapers, etc) should be from the 1880s, and NOT conform to the comic style (besides the halftone pattern). Imagine we’re peering inside a very well researched cowboy comic set in 1889.

# Mockup

(some differences in halftone size, due to a switch from one scale to another mid-mockup. This will be completely consistent in the game) 

![](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jwxiuqhrjmw77n0/LoFi-Magnify-SM.png?raw=1)

# Design notes

## Orbullets

The bullets you collect are characters, living creatures. Who knows how they came to be, or why they love being loaded up in a gun and shot at folks, but they did, and they do.

## Bank Robbin’

Can you hit all the orange pegs?

![](https://www.dropbox.com/s/od1sa1fkql8cjar/Bank_Robbing_.png?raw=1)

## Navigatin’

Can you conquer the mesas?

Instead of Peglin’s two round obstacles at the bottom of the play area, we have thematic shaped obstacles, like these mesas.

Navigation will have to have different sources of damage: hot sun, thirst, or whatever.

  

![](https://www.dropbox.com/s/kt33sl53b0pxjks/Navigation.png?raw=1)

## Ropin’

Cattle have gotten out! Round ‘em up!

  

The bull is slow, but will steadily walk towards your orb, and then CHARGE from time to time. The cows should probably move around.

  

![](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ieimg2yb64crgzn/Roping.png?raw=1)

  

  

## Safe Crackin’

Can you figure out the combination?

Pretty sure hitting pegs in order’s a recipe for frustration, and no fun. How can we capture the precision and skill of cracking a safe in a game about randomness and the unexpected?

  

![](https://www.dropbox.com/s/upopjveaoyipk69/Safe_Cracking.png?raw=1)

![](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ymzgvk3lv8meky5/Safe_Cracking2.png?raw=1)

  

  

## Safe Lootin’

Grab the loot afore you git caught!

When you’re wanted or when you’ve messed up, red bullets will start flying slowly through the level, causing you damage when you collide with them.

![](https://www.dropbox.com/s/66gx3d1fj825kzr/Safe_Looting.png?raw=1)

  

  

## Shootin’

Ken yuh kill the feller dead?

Unsure if putting the character in the play field makes sense. Sounds fun to bounce the bullets off of him, but does it work in-game?

  

![](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ndq0nubhzhvrofg/Shootout.png?raw=1)

  

  

  

## Train Job

Can yeh fetch the loot from the train?

Train should be moving forward, you’ve got a limited time before the authorities arrive and start shooting bullets.

## Misc. UI notes.

# Mechanics 

A series of basic shootouts.

# Basic Shootout

Basic Pegs

Basic Orb

  

Refresh Pegs

Basic OrbGun chamber

  

Flying Bullets (and some way to ramp them up over time?)

  

Orb aiming indicator (just a gun barrel pointing in the correct direction?)

Health Bar

Enemy Health Bar

Some way to progress to the next battle when you’ve won.

Various enemy play field designs

## Additions

Once we’ve got the basic shootout, then we can start adding on mechanics to switch up the formula:

Target pegs (hit enough orange pegs to win)

Ordered pegs (hit in order to win, if you hit them out of order, reset)

Moving Pegs

$ pegs, and some way to spend them

Obstacles (mesas, cacti, etc.)

Map

New types of orbs

Durable pegs

Crit pegs

#  Hades-inspired mechanics

Armor bar on pegs or enemies, preventing some effects until depleated.

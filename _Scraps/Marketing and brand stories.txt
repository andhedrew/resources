I’ve talked to 8,000 business owners in the last 4 years at my day job. Here’s what I learned about marketing:

**Start With Your Customer**

Marketing is every interaction a business has with its customers, so it stands to reason that an effective business should have a holistic understanding of who their ideal customer is - and why they make buying decisions. For many, this is the solution to increasing sales.

When a business truly understands their customer (nearly as well as the customer understands themselves), marketing simply becomes engagement - and everything falls into place.

I'm not talking about demographic research. This is psychographics, and gathering good context around your ideal customer is the most important part of operating a business.

**1. Basic customer context: pain, status, and stories**

People don't just buy products. They tell themselves stories about how the pain they’re moving away from might be affecting their perceived status.

You need to align your business, product, offer, or advertisements with this story.
People want to feel smarter, sexier, and wealthier.

When something might make them seem dumb, ugly, or poor - they stay away.
Status is the ultimate persuader.

We tend to make buying decisions when we want to look or feel healthier, make (or prevent losing) money, or improve our relationships:

* **Your customer doesn’t just want a couch;** they’re sick of not being able to get comfortable when watching their favorite TV show, they’re tired of the back pain, or they want to impress their friends with built-in cup holders.
* **They don’t just want a washing machine;** they just got a new job and can’t stand the thought of being seen at the laundromat.

**Nobody buys a product.** They buy the story they tell themselves.

Consider your product niche, and spend a few minutes writing down 10-20 stories your customers might be telling themselves when moving away - or towards pleasure.

What do you sell?
What pain are they moving away from if they buy your product?

Then, write down 10-20 stories customers might tell themselves about how your product will increase their perceived status, or decrease the risk of losing status.

_This context will help with two things:_

* Angles (in your advertising, website, or product offers)
* Finding your ideal customers

**2. Where are your customers? Who already captured their attention?**

Once you've identified the stories customers are telling themselves when moving away from pain/towards pleasure, finding your customer is much easier.

**YOUR CUSTOMER DOES NOT CARE ABOUT YOUR BUSINESS.**

**THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT YOUR BRAND STORY.**

They simply tell themselves stories about pain, pleasure, and status.

Your job is to align your business with the stories they tell themselves.

* Where do your customers go when experiencing pain, or moving towards pleasure?
* What are they searching for on Google?
* What blogs are they reading?
* What Facebook groups are they in?
* Are there online communities like forums they participate in?
* What Instagram profiles are they following?
* Who do they watch on YouTube?

Initially, it might be challenging to come up with this information. 

But if you put yourself in your customer’s shoes, and start Googling the things you think they’d search for - things will slowly (and then very quickly) start coming together. 

I also included some free tools in the appendix at the bottom of this guide to help speed up this process.

Make a list of as many of these as possible. 

This is important for two reasons:
1. You’ll now have a list of the ‘influencers’ who’ve already captured your audience’s attention. If you find them, you’ll find your customers.
2. You’ll have a better understanding of the customer’s problem intensity.

Having a better understanding of the intensity of the customer’s problem will allow you to more easily put yourself in their shoes - and position your products, ads, and website in a way that speaks their language.

**3. WORLDS MOST POWERFUL MARKETING TOOL**

The below tactic will work on any social platform, and was popularized by Russell Brunson. We’ll use Facebook as an example.

First, identify the top 50-100 groups or pages your ideal customers are in.
Then, delete your personal Facebook account.

Or just start a brand new one. And…

**ONLY FOLLOW PAGES YOUR IDEAL CUSTOMERS ARE FOLLOWING.**

Everything you see on social media will now be the same your ideal customers are seeing.

_This will give you:_

* The current stories customers are telling themselves (via comments)
* The strategies these 50-100 pages/groups are using to build their audience
* Access to an endless resource of customers
* You can repeat this process with Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, etc.

What now? Pay attention, and find ways to get in front of them.

Join the top 50-100 Facebook Groups your customers are already in.

Become an active contributing member. Be valuable. Respond to comments.
Don’t expect anything in return - just be there.

You will be seen, and you will be remembered.

**4. Get people talking**

Word of mouth is still the most powerful agent in contagion today.

Figure out the smallest number of customers needed to launch this business effectively.

E.g, 2,000 hard rock fans who listen to Audioslave and similar bands in Brooklyn.
They will spread the word for you. 

To increase the odds of virality, create a talk trigger (do something remarkable / relevant / controversial) to get people talking.

For example, Five Guys restaurant not only stuffs their fry boxes with loads of french fries - but they also dump a bunch in the bag too. Another example is DoubleTree hotels - every guest gets a free warm chocolate chip cookie. Both of these are examples of famous triggers used to leverage the power of word of mouth.

A similar strategy leverages loss-leading. Costco actually loses money on their chicken. It’s so cheap - it gets people talking. Why do they do this? They keep their chicken at the back of the store, so you have to walk through the entire store - past hundreds of products - to get the cheap chicken.

_Here’s the most important part:_

It must align with the stories they’re telling themselves when moving away from pain, or towards pleasure (in health, wealth, or relationships).

**Appendix**

If the main point you've taken away from this is that you should have a better understanding of who your customer is, you're already ahead in this game.

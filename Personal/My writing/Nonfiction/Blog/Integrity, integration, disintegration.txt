Integrity, integration, disintegration.

These are your dominoes, the dominoes of your life:

Pic

Around them, are all the dominoes of your family and home:

Pic

Around those dominoes, are your extended family, friends, church, local community:

Pic

Around those, are the wider culture and the world:

Let’s look at your dominoes. You’ve got your relational dominoes, career dominoes, health dominoes:

Pic

Every aspect of your life is represented here. If every aspect of your life was put together , your dominoes would be a nice, orderly circle:

Pic 

But here’s the problem: dominoes tip. We neglect our health, and that domino tips, hitting other dominoes.
Pic
 It hits our dominoes, and it hits our families’ dominoes. Because out health is suffering, our career suffers because we can’t work so much. See ya, career domino!

Pic

Our career domino takes out our finances domino, and our marriage domino. Yoour spouse’s and kid’s dominoes begin to fall:

Pic

We’re getting a big change reaction, just because  one domino fell.

Pic

If you’re a particularly considerate (or, more likely, guilt-oriented) person, you might try to help set up your family’s dominoes before you set up your own. Say your poor health has affected your relationship with your wife and kids: you spend so much time feeling crappy that you don’t much time to spend with them. Guilt might drive you to try to set up their dominoes while your health domino is still down, but look what happens:

Pic

Your fallen domino is taking up space in their lives. All the dominoes in their lives now are a little more cramped, a little closer together.

Pic

 This means if one of their dominoes fall, or one of your dominoes fall they’re likely to hit more dominoes than usual, and chain reactions are more dangerous and bigger. 

Having one domino down means everything is harder: it’s harder to have a good career if your finances suck, it’s hard to be healthy if you hate your work, it’s hard to be a good employee when your marriage is on the rocks.

Of course, most of us don’t have just one domino down. Most of our lives look roughly like this:

Pic

We frantically set dominoes back up, but they’re falling faster than we can set them up. Our car breaks down because our finances and our home dominoes are down. A check bounces because our career domino is down. Our health domino is down because we’re getting depressed because our purpose domino is down.

But there’s worse news. As our family’s dominoes fall, they start creating random chain reactions in our family and community:

Pic

This is why most bad things happen. Individual people are neglectful of their dominoes, and enough personal dominoes down causer really, really big dominoes to fall. A cop nurses his hatred and resentment until it explodes in violent force. A overworked man with too many dominoes down falls asleep and strikes a cyclist. 

They’re all chain reactions - sometimes very long chain reactions that are difficult to trace.

Pic

If by magic we all set up our dominoes perfectly, there are still random events and difficulties, but so much trouble and suffering would be eliminated overnight.

Pic of all dominoes set up:

 No dominoes down, nothing going wrong, no bad chain reactions. It’s full integration, as the opposite of disintegration. All the dominoes are integrated into our circle. This is called integrity.



So, we should set up our dominos. 

Let’s resolve to set up our health domino. We get out and go for a run, it’s going to be our new daily habit. But your husband starts criticizing you for exercising when the house is a mess. He’s not usually this critical, but work has been killing him lately. 
You stop running, because you really should take care of the house. 
Your husband’s career domino just knocked your health domino over before you even got it set up.

Or maybe you want to do more work on a passion project, to set up your purpose domino - but your friend who never found work their purpose talks you down and convinces you that it’s a waste of time. Your friend’s domino just knocked over yours.

The problem is this: our dominos are surrounded by everyone else’s.

It’s not just a case of putting our oxygen mask on first: we have to put on our oxygen mask while many other people are trying to yank the oxygen mask out of your hands. Most of these people aren’t malicious, they just have their own domino problems, and are looking to justify them. There’s nothing that makes a person feel better about their toppled dominoes than convincing someone else that it’s impossible to set the dominoes back up.

Pic

But, let’s say we get our “sleep” domino set up. It’s next to our health domino, so it will give us more room to set health up:

There are big dominoes, giant dominoes out beyond out little ring. We might try to set them up without setting our own circles up, but that’s not a great idea, for two reasons:

First, these big dominos are big for a reason. Everyone else’s dominoes are buffeting them at all times - A lot of little dominoes can tip over one of the big dominoes, and they’re the end of some very long chain reactions.  They’re heavy, ponderous things, and some of them have been down since the beginning of time. When we abandon our circle of dominoes to try and put up a big domino, we’re fighting an almost impossibly difficult war.

Pic

But let’s say you’re very dedicated and very intelligent, and you rally the troops to actually set up one of these dominoes. Great! Of course, it’s difficult to tell how heavy they are until you’re lifting them, and they’re awkwardly shaped and eroded from years of being flat on the ground.
This brings us to the second reason big dominoes are hard to fix: we don’t know how to make them stand up. If you try and fail at standing your own dominoes up, they cause small chain reactions and tiny problems.

If you try and fail to set a big domino up, it might fall over, crushing everything in its path.

Pic

Because big things are hard to fix. If they were easy to fix, they would be fixed. But big things are hard to fix, and often the attempted cure has unexpected consequences.

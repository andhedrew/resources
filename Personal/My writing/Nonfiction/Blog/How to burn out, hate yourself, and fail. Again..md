Hey!

I figured some of you are peaceful, productive, and well-balanced, and are looking for a good old-fashioned bout with burnout. So! Here's all of the ways that I've found to crash, burn, hate my project, and hate myself! If that's what you're looking for, give these a try.

### Try to be someone else
You're inadaquate, of course you are. But instead of dealing with your inadaquacy through hard work and learning, try to make a soulless copy of someone else, that will surely lead to the same success they enjoy.

### Obsess about more successful people
Obsess about people who are more successful than you, have more time than you, are luckier than you, have better timing than you, have better lives than you, are younger than you, are more experienced than you - the more you obsess about them, the worse you will feel about your work. As a bonus, you'll also waste a ton of time!

### Focus on the impossibly huge and overwhelming
Don't focus on getting a character moving around - you don't want small steps or easily achivable mini-goals. Focus on bigger problems first, insuring that you'll be overwhelmed and frustrated.

### Sprint every day, all the time
Every scrap of time should be spent working. If you fail and take a nap, a shower, or a few minutes to think, beat yourself up for failing to live up to your impossible standard.

### Stay in the closed mode.
You have creative, playful, good ideas when you're in open mode, as John Cleese points out, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5oIIPO62g, so stay away from open mode. Stay in closed mode, and you'll create a lot of uncreative, crappy work that you'll hate. You'll have a vague feeling that you *should* have better ideas, but if you stay in closed mode you'll never be able to come up with them. This will be profoundly frustrating and demoralizing.

### Underestimate luck.
Labor under the illusion if you can just copy Stardew Valley faithfully enough, you'll definitely have the same sales numbers. Believe wholeheartedly that timing and luck have nothing to do with it, and you'll set yourself on a discouraging, humiliating path to failure. When you inievitibly fail, then become bitter and *overestimate* luck, which will have much the same effect.
Do not focus on your work, doing it as best you can, waiting for good luck to show up when it's ready.

### Prioritize projects that will be popular over projects that are personally interesting.
You first goal should be to become an overnight success. This will garuntee that you'll impulsively ping-pong from project to project depending on which one looks like the best bet, and give up in frustration  when noone cares about your game that looks like everyone else's game.

### Put the cart waaay before the horse.
Don't work on the game, don't learn the fundimentals, don't game jam. Just learn things that are impossibly far away, like optimizing your steam tags. This will clutter your mind up with information that is of no use to you right now. It will make you feel like you're making progress, while prevent you from making any useful progress whatsoever. It will also be profoundly frustrating.

### Find advice from several successful developers, and try to follow them to the letter.
Believe that they definitely know how to replicate their success, and have a step-by-step map that will lead you to the exact same success. Don't just take what tips you can from them and try to forge your own path - treat their paths as the only true paths, and follow them blindly. This will lead you to frustrating and contridictory strategies, and keep you focused on the process of getting popular, instead of on your game.

### Pay lots of money to feel ok about procrastinating.
Learning is only important if it costs a lot, and keeps you from doing your work. You feel a lot better about getting nothing done if you've spend 3 months and $275 dollars on a courses which you didn't finish while failing to take notes or do any of the homework. This kind of investment can make you feel better about procrastination, and if you pursue the courses halfheartedly enough, you won't get any benefit from it, either.

### Focus on getting the right technology.
Believe what you have is not enough, and that you definitely have to have top-of-the-line gear to be able to take the first step. Thoroughly convince yourself that course correction is impossible, meaning that you'll have to make all the right choices at the beginning. This will leave you stressed. out and paralyzed.

### Spend most of your time spamming your work.
Spend a day learning the basics of making game art, and then spend a few weeks marketing your half-finished sprite. No one will like it, and you'll have wasted your time and diluted everyone else's life with your low-effort attempts.

### Any time not working should be spent obsessing about how much you wish you could we working.
This will breed frustration, and you'll undermine the rest of your life, leading to more frustration and chaos.

### Rest should be rare, and filled with passive entertainment.
Never truly rest. Don't just lay down and relax when you're weary. Instead, try to squeeze in some YouTube. This will undermine your ability to rest (thus undermining any productivity) and it will fill your mind with noise, insuring that stray ideas that might improve your game won't enter your head.

### Self care should be nonexistent.
Tell yourself that 10 minutes taking a shower is 10 minutes that you can't spare. Get and stay relentlessly impatient.
When you don't take care of yourself, your health will start to suffer, your relationships will suffer, and your emotional life will suffer. This will undermine your work, and make you miserable.

### Use work as punishment.
If you accidentally get 8 hours of sleep, do something for fun, or spend more than the absolute minimum amount of time preparing your meals, use excessive amounts of work as punishment. This will be profoundly demoralizing in the moment, and over the passage of time will make you hate your work.

### Secretly believe that you're the best.
Nurse your egotism. Get angry at people who succeed in spite of making work that is "flawed". tell yourself, frequently, "I could have done that. Heck, I could do even better". Don't try to do better, tell yourself that there's no point in trying. Remember that if you try, you might feel inadaquate and you might not be able to hold on to your delusions of granduer. 

### Try to get rich quick.
Read about people who have gotten rich, consume media that makes you envious. Follow this up with manic bursts of work, telling yourself that if you can just push hard enough for a few days, you could get a lot of money and success very quickly. These unsustainable bursts will set you up to crash, reinforcing the feeling that you're a failure.

### Tie your entire self worth to the number of likes/upvotes/retweets you get on social media.
When people ignore you on social media, you'll feel worthless and talentless. When you get a lot of attention, that will amp up the pressure on you, and make it more likely that you'll be too afraid and perfectionistic to post the next thing you make.

### Use social media to stoke your feeling of being an imposter.
As you scroll through the life's work of people who are more talented than you, tell yourself that it came easy to them, that they're just naturals, that you'll never be at their level. This will make any attempt to improve your work seem futile.


### Tell yourself that it should come easily to you.
When you run into a wall, when things are tough, ask yourself if something that you love should be so difficult. Listen to the voice that tells you that it should be easy, that "real" game developers don't struggle to make good work, that talent is all you need.

### Remember that almost everything is just an obstacle.
If you believe that your job, your relationships, your kids are obstacles to your success, then you'll come to believe that they are the reason that you haven't succeeded yet. You'll come to resent them, and you'll feel helpless to move forward until you've moved past these obsticles. Don't focus on what work you can do with the time that you have, don't focus on doing your best in your work, or in being a good parent, or a good spouse - just focus on how frustrating it is to be "held back" by the commitments you've made. This has the useful effect of reducing the sting of failure, since your failures can be blamed on everyone but you.

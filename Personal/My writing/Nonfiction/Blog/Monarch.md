Description
The monarch has two things: vision and authority. He sees things from high up, and he can make descisions rationally and in a timely manor. The monarch can and should mediate between the other three archetypes, engaging each as he sees fit. A monarch without the other arcetypees is a tyrant, or a weak, blind monarch.

Strengths
Vision, decisiveness, leadership. 

Weaknesses
Must engage with other arcetypes.

The Monarch in game development
If you see yourself as an authority, a voice that other people should listen to, then you'd better work hard to cultivate your other archetypes. If you don't, you'll be a weak monarch - a monarch who's afraid to lead becasue they're not compitent - or, even worse, a tyrant who bullies and pushes other people down to cover up their own inadequacies.

How to grow as a Monarch
Be a leader. Take responsibility for those around you, but don't assume that you're entitled to lead: your leadership will be effective only as far as you are compitent, and only if you are very good at taking care of the people around you. You'll need to improve in every other archetype consistently, and you'll need to ally yourself with other people who are even better than you. As a monarch, you dedicate yourself to a life of service and humility. When your team fails, you'll take responsibility for the failure. When your team succeeds, you'll give the credit away to everyone else. When times are tough, you'll be the first to cut your salary. When there's an impossible descision to make, you'll be tkaing on thte burrdan of making it, and you'll have to weather the backlash. We think authority figures get all of the praise and benefits and do none of the work: that's the desciption of a toxic leader. If you are to grow into a good King, a good Queen, then you'll work hard for those you lead, you'll sacrifice and give to make their lives better. You'll lead as an act of service, not because you want all the power.

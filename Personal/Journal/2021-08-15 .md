### What's bothering you?
My preoccupation with things other than my children. I'm constantly drawn to things that pull be away from my children and my duties.

**Is that so bad?**

I feel like a failure of a parent.

**But is every parent who has interests outside parenting a failure?**

No, but I fear that I spend too much time focused on other things. Like right now. I don't want the girls to think "all I care about is work".

**What would prevent that?**

I mean, spending time with them. Focusing on them. Asking them questions, showing interest.

**do you not do those things?**

Yes, but not _enough_. Not consistently. 

**how much is enough?**

That's the problem. No idea.

**maybe you should descide that before you pass judgement on your parenting ability.**

...turns out that the amount of time spent with kids doesn't matter in terms of outcomes, and more time can even be harmful.

** So what are you going to do?**
I'm going to spend special time with the girls every day, and then try not to worry about it after that. Just take opportunies to play with them if they come up.

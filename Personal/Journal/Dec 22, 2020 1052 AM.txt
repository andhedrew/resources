Where am I?

Milford, NE, in the cottage, on the couch.

What am I personally grateful for?

Sonia's ability to prepare gifts.

What am I professionally grateful for?

Ending Thistledown Kickstarter and Sunken Kickstarter and moving on to making video games 100%.

Thoughts

Frustrated that we forgot to deliver Christmas cards for elderly people. The girls made the cards, we just left it too late. Our negligence made Christmas just a little bit worse for some older folks. Blagh. Should have set a reminder immediately. I'm going to call when Pizza Kirch opens and see if we can still drop them off. (we could)

The one thing I most want to accomplish today.

Changes to Sunken proof.

Where am I?

Milford, NE, on the couch.

What am I personally grateful for?

My new giant 4k monitor

What am I professionally grateful for?

Finishing Good and Dead today. Hopefully.

Thoughts

Sonia's sick, getting a COVID test. Uncle Dave has been diagnosed. It's been a pretty good year for us, but a rough year for lots of other folks. Ready for 2021.

The one thing I most want to accomplish today.

Finish, polish, and launch Good and Dead.

> "The extension of the term 'Addiction', for example, to cover any undesirable but nonetheless gratifying behavior that is repeated, is one example of denial of personal agency that has swiftly percolated downward from academe."



It's a bad idea that infects people.

I was conscious, whenever I was tempted to sin, of a tightness in my stomach that I couldn't identify. This tightness didn't really make sense to me: it wasn't desire, nor was it the shooting balls of energy that drive me forward to seek dopamine. (typing the word dopamine also gives me this feeling, which makes perfect sense, as we shall soon see) It's a feeling of deep anxiety and weakness.

Only in the light of the above quote do I realize what that tightness was.

Anxiety, deep anxiety. I feared that I couldn't control myself. I'd tie myself into knots trying to distract or divert myself, because I believed that I was out of control, that I couldn't do what I wanted. That it wasn't I who was making the choice, but something in me - my ADHD driving me on towards dopamine, or my addiction.

Something not-me.

But it seems that it's as simple as this: I like misbehaving. It gives me a rush, and clears my mind of everything except the very short-term. I like how it feels, and I choose to jump into it because I like it.

And I can choose not to. There's nothing driving me, forcing me, or gaining control. There's no addiction, nor is there compulsive behavior, nor is there a sinning beast. I'm just doing something that's very gratifying. I admit it, I like it. But I don't have to do everything I like, there are other things I like that don't have the downsides.

If I misbehave again, it will be because I choose to. I own that fully. I choose, or I choose not to. It will be fully my fault - or it will be my virtue. I was tempted to write "By the grace of God", as if I needed his grace to show up, as if I was hoping I'd get lucky. His grace is already there.

I don't have the pit in my stomach any more.



> **Liam Satchell:** In the case of addiction, where you have a particular substance or behavior that you are obsessed with, you cannot move away from, it preoccupies all your thoughts to the point that it is destroying your social, occupational or social life. That's a particularly strong set of behaviors, and a particularly unique outcome.

> **Jason Feifer:** So, how do you measure this? How do you look at any set of behaviors and say, this is addiction? Well, just a moment ago, we heard the news of this alarming study, people check their phones every 12 minutes. That sounds like a lot. So, maybe frequency of use is a good factor in identifying addiction. But Liam says, no, that by itself says nothing.

> **Liam Satchell:** I eat every day. That doesn't mean I'm pathologically addicted to eating because it's part of my routine.

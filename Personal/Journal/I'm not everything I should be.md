## I'm not everything I should be.

But I can see what I should be. I'm 32. I've got 30 seasons until I turn 40. If I picked 30 ways that I'm not what I should be and really worked to make them better, who could I be?

1. I still look at porn sometimes.
2. I stay up too late.
3. I get so focused that I lose my temper. 
4. I'm too focused on myself
5. I take feelings too seriously.
6. I'm not the father I could be.
7. I don't have much of a relattionship with God.
8. I still long to be Peter Pan, I look back and my old work and pine for the plurality of my potential. 
9. I'm not the friend I shoud be.
10. I'm not direct and athoritative enough.
11. I'm not hard-working enough, too lazy.
12. I tend to let things slide wih house maintenance.
13. I still am a people pleaser.
14. I don't spemd emough time and attention on meetting new people.
15. I still cave to social anxiety- I know that I ought to strike up conversations, but I'm too wound tight.

21. I focus more on what I can get than what I can do for others.
22. I'm not dedicated to one pursuit at the eexpense of others, I'm spread too thin.
23. I numb my mind with passive neertainment, but I don't allow myself to rest. I'm either driving myself to do the optimal responsible hting, or I'm letting my brain bleed out my ears.
24. I am too anxious about things that probobly won't happen. I don't look up odds, and I don't research often enough.
25. I'm not romantic enough.
26. I'm not giving or thoughtful enough with others.

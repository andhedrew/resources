Where am I?

What am I personally grateful for?

Matthew, we had a good conversation last night.

Getting Bonespur plot figured out

Thoughts

I want to paint more. Painting takes a long time, but itâ€™s really fun. Full painting seems to take 3-4 days of work. Not terrible. I really want to paint during the day, should I?

The one thing I most want to accomplish today.

I need to get gumroad books shipped out today.

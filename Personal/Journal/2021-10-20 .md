### What are my flaws? What am I doing wrong?

I'm impatient. I think that a short period of concentrated effort is all I need to succeed. I'm trying to get lucky, while discounting steady work.

I'm not mindful about my eating, or my media consuption. I still chase after the impulse to be stimulated all the time.



### What's one thing that I could do (and that I will do) that will improve me?

I could set a reminder to be mindful, edp about eating and media.

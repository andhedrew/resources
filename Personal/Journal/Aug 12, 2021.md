I don't  know how today went. I never know.

I think I did ok as a parent, giving lillian and ellie rides in the wagon, applying the "code of Paparabi" appropriately.

The house is a wreck, even though I had the girls clean up everything, and I washed all the dishes. How quickly things just fall to pieices.

I did get sidetracked and started a Kiickstartter campaign, don't know if I'll continue iit.

I need to read more james gurney, I should sett those books out.

Again: no work or email in the morning? I think that worked well. I did a few wheel spins and I think I focues on the girls a bit more.

Merarg.

I hate how I'm so much in a cloud these days. Probably divided attention. How about no devices until after I drop them off?

Anything wrong with that?

No wheel spinning.

Ok, you can wheel spin, but no leaving the app.

:D

Maybe I'll reclaim some of my brain, and the fog will lift. Maybe.

Maybe anti-fog can only be bought at the price of boredom. So be it.

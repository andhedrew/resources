Thoughts

What's next? What's my daily process? What's my weekly process? What's the process that will gradually improve everything?

Lack of faith has handicapped my paintings in the past. faith that the effort would be worth it. There's a lot of uncertainty where the painting looks terrible. Faith that farther work will improve it is vital.

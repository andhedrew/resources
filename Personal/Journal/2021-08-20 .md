### What's bothering you?
_Ask searching questions_
Nothing, except I need to exercise more.  Worked with Davey, got a lot of work done, good work, then  I meditated and brushed my teeth,  then we played some dark souuls for the first time (yikes)  now I took a shower and will get off to bed presently. I'm. not anxious about getting to bed quickly because I slept in with Lillian today.

### What are you grateful for?
Josh mentioning that walking 3 miles really gave him a ton of energy and motivation. I will pray that he continues that practice.

### What can you improve tomorrow?
Exercise? I'm going to track my steps to see how much I really walk throughout the course of the day.

### Other thoughts?
Anya and I. did improv games today, we'll do them with Ellie tomorrow (she'll love them). Lillian's been talking a lot. Things are pretty good.

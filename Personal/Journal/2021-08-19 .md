### What's bothering you?
_Ask searching questions_
Not working enough.

Why is that bothering you?

Because I want to make amazing art.

Will not working enough prevent that?

Obviously.

Why?

Because I won't get as much work done.

You'll get less work done han if you didn't have kids, but it doesn't mean you can't make good work.

It slows it down, though. A lot.

Is there anything you can do to speed up the process?

I can keep the houuse ttidy (so I can work more instead of washing dishes or some crap in thte evening) and work duuring Lillian's naps... maybe.

### What are you grateful for?
Lillian noticed the dark tonight, so I took her outside, and she was deeply interested. She said "dark" over and over agian, and was STARING, like ttotally focused.

### What can you improve tomorrow?
Work during Lillian's nap. Keep up Ellie and Papa time.

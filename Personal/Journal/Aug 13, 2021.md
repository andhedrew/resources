Eh. Had a nice evening with Sonia, got some work done on Marrowroot.

I can't remember this morning.

Oh, I helped Anya make pie crust for Key Lime Pie Frozen Yogurt.

There's a mess everywhere.

I should go to the park tomorrow, but I don't want to.

Maybe I should.

Sigh.

Never enough time.

I wonder if I'm doing ok as a dad.

I wonder if I'll ever get a publisher.

Crisis of confidence, of course that happens multiple times dailyy, it seems like.

Tomorrow: I'll try to get thee house spotless.

Where am I?

Milford

What am I personally grateful for?

Ellie’s cheerful “I love you!” this morning…after waking me up 2-3 times last night.

 

What am I professionally grateful for?

Maybe finally cracking the Marrowroot art style

Thoughts

The discovery of and discussion between the King, the Warrior, The Magician, and the Lover has been very helpful, even if the book is a bit mysto.

The one thing I most want to accomplish today.

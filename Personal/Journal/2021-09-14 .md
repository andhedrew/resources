### What's bothering you?
_Ask searching questions_
Not much. Sonia and I worked out Lillian's scan, so we're moving forward with that and I feel ok about it.
### What are you grateful for?
Marrowroot, my new tablet, my girls, sonia, someone paying for our meal the other day.
### What worked today?
Going outside. I felt better quickly.
### What didn't work?
Obsessing.
### What can you improve tomorrow?
Jump right into spinning the wheel.
### Anything memorable happen today?
I called the hospital right away, not procrastination. That youtube channel about anxiety is good.

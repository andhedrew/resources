Thoughts

Screw 12 hour days where Sonia wakes up at 4:00. Screw them. She wakes up Lillian, and then I spend the rest of the time (until ellie wakes up) either rocking lillian until my arms fall off or lying down with her on my chest while my arms fall asleep and my feet freeze because I can't cover them up without waking up lillian. Little good it does me, because every time the bloody fridge cycles it wakes her up, every time the train goes by, every time Sonia blows her nose, every time there's any little freaking noise she wakes up and has to be rocked back to sleep. I'm so angry with Sonia.

The one thing I most want to accomplish today.

Screw you.

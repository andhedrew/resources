_journal

## Aug 11, 2021 

Today was I don't really know. it was a day, I woke up, tried to do some good parenting stuff, worked/obsessed about "image brushes" for Photoshop, going as for as posting freelance reequests on Fiverr for a developer to make a photoshop plugin for me...then I realized that I had the software I needed, bought it a while ago. oops.

But i got osme work done, the new, new, new, new, new, new, _new_ art style is coming along well. I't much more ground-up and holistic, if that makes sense?

I have a nagging fear that today was Grandma's Birthday.

I can't even remember what happened with the girls today. Blurrr. It's too late to be up, anyhow.

Tomorrow: I donno. At least I'm journaling.

I'll try this: no work, email, or work stuff in the morning. No work. No buzzing. Just open, right-brained me.

Mycelium. Twisted strands carrying their messages, whispers twisting their way through the timeless earth. Peoples may rise, live, be slaughtered, the earth may burn- the mycelium  continues its quiet whispering, hiding secrets in the blackened earth, twisting upward, dragging deep lies to the surface, eating decayed and wilting flesh, the mycelium grows: riddling the earth with its dead white song, inhabiting the timbers of our homes, the corpses of the innocent...and me.

## Good/Bad CTR?

What exactly is a good CTR anyway, and how do we decide when to switch it out? I asked a few local Montreal indie studios for their CTRs and compared it with ours, and it seems like 2% is the the minimum you’d want as a CTR at any point in time.

Lifetime CTR for some of our games. *Note Moon Hunters is the only game that’s out right now.

Mondo Museum’s CTR is quite high. This can be for any number of reasons, though at the time of recording it, it was quite a new announcement and lots of museum-related people were clicking on our links to see it. Additionally, not very many games have the word “museum” in them, which is probably quite intriguing.

You can see [Lucifer Within Us](https://store.steampowered.com/app/717560/Lucifer_Within_Us/) is JUST below the threshold, which might mean its capsule isn’t attractive enough. It’ll likely be swapped out soon.

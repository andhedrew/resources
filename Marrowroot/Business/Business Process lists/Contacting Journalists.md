## Prep
      

- Avoid empty words like "my game has a good story/amazing worlds". Those are marketing words used in every single press release, and have no value at all. Meaningless. Try to pinpoint exactly what makes the world so amazing.

- First of all, make a HUGE list of everything that's unique/awesome about your game. Try to write 100 things that make our game interesting. Seriously. Try it. Then categorize them. Pick the best ones. Those are gonna be your 'hooks' to write about to journalists.

## Write a pitch
      
	  
	        

- Briefly introducing yourself or your team is also a good idea, provided the email doesn't get too long.

- An easy to read email that's neither a sentence-long nor a huge wall of text has a better chance of getting read. Formatting, punctuation and a modest length (of say 3-4 paragraphs) are important.

- Always have a nice picture of your game embedded in the body of the email. It helps in giving an idea of what it's all about.

      

- Speaking of help, make sure to help the journo you are contacting cover your game. Don't make the poor soul search for trailers, pictures, website links, available formats, platforms, prices (or whether a game is freeware), official press releases (if any) and other crucial information. Provide with links to the important stuff.


- Most people prefer a web-based presskit instead of downloading .zip files. Presskit() comes highly recommended.
- Also provide a .zip files. Being able to download a presskit with logos, screenshots, etc., is very helpful.

      

- Humour works. As does being nice.

      

- Get quickly to the point. Make sure I (for example, that is) immediately learn why your game is interesting and what's so special about it. Why will I love it?

      

 - Oh, and do mention that you 'd love to answer questions.

      

  

- If possible, provide a download, Steam/iOS/whatever key of your game. Don't ask if we want one; we need one -- writing about a game means that we must be able to play it without paying.

      

- Journalists are LAZY. Don't assume they're gonna click any url you put in your mail. Don't assume they're gonna be interested. Don't assume they're even gonna read anything. Make sure your email subject is interesting, and the body is short and to the point. Journalists don't have time to read your story. They want snappy points about why your game is unique and deserves to be written about. They also want images and video's. Don't just make random screenshots, think about the story you want to tell. Show the most interesting parts. Make it easy for them: they don't want to spend time on reading your website and asking you stuff, so give them those story 'hooks'. By doing so, you're already **writing their article for them.**

      

- Journalists also like it if you're personal. Let them know you're not just writing the same email to everybody, compliment them on their articles. Try to put yourself in their shoes: you're getting 100s of emails a day, all from desperate indie devs or PR companies. Which one will you write about? Which emails will you even OPEN to read?

Dear [influencer],

  

You don't play solitaire like I play solitaire. When I play, there's blood in the streets. Today, I invite you to play solitaire like I do with _Solitaire Combat_, my unique spin on the classic game beloved by millions. It will be available on Steam on November 22, 2012.

  

_Solitaire Combat_ brings this classic to life with 3D graphics and unique characters designed by the award-winning artist Hugo Viggo. To play, each player constructs a deck of cards and pits them against their opponent. Weapon upgrades, customizable skillsets, and even special hats change the balance of power every minute and enable players to snatch victory from the bloody jaws of defeat -- or defeat from the grinning maw of victory. If you are interested in writing a review, please let me know. Thank you!

## Deliver a pitch

      

1. Email a prelaunch pitch to the influencers on your media list

2. Follow up with a telephone call or email two to three days later

3. Email a release date pitch to the influencers on your media list

4. Follow up with a telephone call or email two to three days later

  

So when do you send a pitch? Prelaunch pitches are sent approximately three months before launch and release date pitches are sent a week or two before launch. (Big budget releases may pitch earlier and more frequently, but they have both a larger game and a larger budget that warrants, and can support, a more intense marketing effort.)

I've seen a lot of interest in marketing related content on here lately and wanted to share some quick thoughts on which subs you should post your game to & how to do it. A lot of subs have strict rules about self promotion, so I included some thoughts about common pitfalls to avoid as well.

For examples of modest success, I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/8bh7bm/as_a_parttime_indie_dev_its_easy_to_feel_like/) and [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/8tdbp1/all_the_steam_games_in_my_favorite_subgenre/) about our upcoming game Card Crusade that have been relatively well received (~60k views) and have been pretty much the sole basis for our play-testers list (besides friends and family).

Anyway, the case for posting on social media has been heavily restated in the last couple of months so I won't belabor it here. This is purely meant as a helpful overview or quick reference.

Oh, and I listed the subs in order of most to fewest subscribers.

-----------------------------------------------

[r/gaming](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming) (18m subscribers)

This is the biggest gaming subreddit with the most potential for capturing gamers. If you never post to [r/gaming](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming), you are missing out on tens of thousands of potential sales.

**What** _**won't**_ **work:** blogs, self posts

**What** _**will**_ **work:** memes, interesting/awesome/clever game play gifs(Seriously consider posting memes as a legitimate, professional marketing strategy.)

[r/games](https://www.reddit.com/r/games) (1m subscribers)

Very different audience than [r/gaming](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming) -- these are the core gamers who are much more interested in discussing and discovering new games than the casuals. This is the most reliable place to post your blog, as long as it's something interesting and not just a devlog update.

**What** _**won't**_ **work:** memes, most self posts

**What** _**will**_ **work:** game announcements, in-depth analysis of a particular genre, game, or game mechanic (and of course mention your game in the comments).

[r/gamedev](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev) (268k subscribers)

You're not actually allowed to announce game updates and do regular marketing here -- plus, game devs are probably not your core audience anyway, so I wouldn't focus here too much.

**What** _**won't**_ **work:** memes, game announcements

**What** _**will**_ **work:** post-mortems, tutorials, motivational posts, anything that has to do with free assets (seriously you guys lose your minds over free assets)

[r/indiegaming](https://www.reddit.com/r/indiegaming) (109k subscribers)

This is an EXTREMELY visual sub. If your game is visually appealing, you could make a gif of some cool new thing you added and post it there once a month.

**What** _**won't**_ **work:** low quality content (including memes), anything that requires reading

**What** _**will**_ **work:** videos/gifs/screenshots that show off something visually appealing

Hope this helps. Let me know what you think!

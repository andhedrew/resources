Where are these people that already are (mostly) convinced? Do they play similar games? Do they enjoy games in your aesthetic? Are there non-games-related forums your audience might gather? Look at your competition - where is their community from? Where do they talk? What streamers play the game? Make notes, and make yourself a good mental model of where these audiences are and how you can reach them.


The game itself would never wink at you - but the marketing could. How would a passerby describe this game to a friend? How would you like them to describe it?


**Take inventory of your resources.**

This is where you start listing what all works in your favour: do you have existing fanbase?

Do you have existing contacts at major websites? Do you know people who work at platforms?
Is your game likely to be considered for awards?

make a press-list with press contacts that gave games similar to yours good reviews.

Create a presskit.

Write some code that outputs screenshots from your game during testing automatically.

Make trailers, write copy, create your blurb, reach out to press to discuss your game. E-mail Geoff Keighley. Message whoever the biggest influencer alive is this week.

Most of all: write a document - that document is your marketing plan, and while it won't be defining, it will be guiding.


Your goal is relatively simple: get people to [enter the funnel](https://ltpf.ramiismail.com/funnel/), ensure that people have repeat exposure to the game, and do it all in a way that allows you to see what works and what doesn't.


1.    
    I write down my goals: what am I trying to achieve, and by when.
2.  I define three audiences: the **90% convinced group** (all they need is to see that the game exists), the **75% convinced group** (they might enjoy the game if they see it repeatedly), and the **50% convinced group** (they are skeptical, but can be convinced by people talking about the game).
3.  I define three moments: **the announcement** (for a slow burn campaign I prefer about twelve to eighteen months out, for a blitz campaign this is three to six months out), **the big wait** (the period between the announcement and the release), and **the release push** (generally the last three-to-six weeks before release, including previews and reviews).
4.  I ask the developer to make a matrix and decide what the strategy is for the **intersection of audiences and moments**. Some are relatively straight-forward: I personally don't believe the 50% group will quickly be convinced without (very) positive external mentions - so for announcement I might focus on press, but I won't have a strong focus on the group during the big wait. Some of them are more complicated: the **big wait** for the 75% group can be incredibly tricky - you need to keep people interested in your game with repeat exposure, but not so much that they stop caring or start being impatient. Don't forget: people rarely unfollow something when it's quiet - silence is a strategy, but it works best if you're already in a good place. The matrix looks as follows:

Taking the above example, since I wrote "focus on press for the 50% group at announcement", I will write that as a header and then write out a max two- or three-paragraph plan that can be executed at that time. That means that even though I can make adjustments at that time, if necessary I can simply take the document and follow the steps in it - it should have a (reference to) a list of assets to create, but also a (reference to) a list people to help create those assets or to reach out to, with their contact details. That way you don't have to spend too much time setting this up when it is time to do marketing - oftentimes there'll be plenty enough on fire as-is at that point.

In the end, this document will be several pages long, and then contain a massive list of names and e-mail addresses and links to articles or videos that made me believe the specific people I'm going to reach out to are a good fit for my game. I save that file, check it occasionally, adjust it liberally, and ignore it frequently - but having the document around means that even in the worst-case scenario, I have a plan that I can act on, or hand off to someone less busy to act on.


1.  Take inventory of your resources. It's easy to make this fast, but you would miss out on a ton of wonderful places to talk about your game. If at the end of taking inventory your resources don't include sites for smaller and debut indie games like [Warpdoor](https://warpdoor.com/) or [Buried Treasure](https://buried-treasure.org/) or [Indie Games Plus](https://indiegamesplus.com/contact/), you should do another pass on this.
2.  Write your marketing plan. There's no wrong way of doing it, besides not doing it and then realizing you would've been better off if you did. I've run marketing campaigns without a single plan - but I've been doing this for more than a decade, keep track of marketing continuously, have a wide network of friends across media, and know what to expect in general of a game launch.
3.  If you have never launched a game, talk to someone who has launched a game. If you know nobody, consider [using my consultancies](https://book.ramiismail.com/) - but keep in mind that literally anyone that has launched a commercial title on the platforms you're launching on will be helpful.

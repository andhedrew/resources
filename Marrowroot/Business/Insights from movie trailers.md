What problem are these movies solving?



# Citizen Kane

"it's a story about a man called Kane - I don't know what to tell you about him, there's so much to say."

Character's widly varying reactions, a string of contridictions, call to decide for yourself.

Problem it solves: Presents a morally complex character, inviting viewers to examine their own morality, and make moral judgements, in light of his. 

Nice "behind the scenes" intro to the actors. Makes you feel like you're invited into the process.

# Psycho
Also behind-the-scenes start.
The most dire, sinister things happened. Contually starting to explain something intriguing, and then inturrupting himself.
Hiding and hinting at intrigue, showing less. He opens the closet, looks at the camera, and closes it.

Feeling like he's examining a real place.

Problem it solves: Creates intrigue, solves the curiosity it creates.

# Jaws
Dark, terrifying, no light. Very simple setup: It's as if God created the devil, and gave him jaws.

Juxtiposing "you knew there was a shark out there" crying dialogue, and happy people playing. Dread.

The hunt - mostly reaction shots and tension. The shark seen by the charactters is much bigger and scarier than the shark seen by the audience.

# Alien
"alien" images and text fading in like hyroglpyhics, strange screetching sounds and heart beat-like sounds.

Gradually ramping up to a creshedo of sound and intense images, and then resolving into...

"In space, no one can hear you scream"

# The abyss
Intrigue about movie production - "Started in a nuclear test site"

Inttrigue about tthe pit "2 1/2 miles, straight down."

Barely showing the creature/light, and then cutting to characters explaining it. Reactions, not the thing itself.

Setting up inter-character conflict

# Strange days
Escapist/indulgent
Confronting the darkness in your soul.

# Spider Man
Intriguing juxtoposition: A helicopter with blades twitching in a web.

# Serious man
Head beating against wall a metiphr for hisfrustrating life, ads intensity.



"What is it?"
"What are characters reacting to?"
"Who is right?"
"What happened here?"

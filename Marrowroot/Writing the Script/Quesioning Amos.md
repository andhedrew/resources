## What do you want?
I want to be a bone warrior, a hard warrior, a man who sands in the rain and lets it run down his nose, a man who doesn't feel the cold, who can be a statue.

## Who is your family?
The pura-pura. I wouldn't tell my kouneli family, because they been good to me, really good to me, but they aren't kin, real kin. I don't know who my kin are, they're mysterious and I've only caught glimpses of what it is to be a pura-pura.

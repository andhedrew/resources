Browse social media to reinforce your suspicion that you're inadequate. There are plenty of examples of people who do things better than you.

Might as well not even try.

Play games and tell yourself that you have to /beat/ your competition. Tell yourself that your work, to be worth anything, has to exceed the work of others in every way. Tell yourself that if you really cared you'd be able to make a game that's as feature-filled as one created by a team of 50 over the course of years. Take your inadequate efforts as proof that you're not good enough to do the work.

Look at a really nice piece of work on social media- maybe some excellently crafted pixel art, a buttery smooth animation, a cleverly coded behavior - and look at how many reactions it got. If it got a lot, you'll feel unhappy about your meagre efforts to promote your work. If it didn't get a lot of likes, retweets, etc. tell yourself that if a post of that quality got ignored, what chance do you have?

Believe deeply that you can't create something that's good, believe that your talent and love aren't sufficient; ignore all evidence to the contrary. Ignore that creator who had a hit even though they hate marketing. Ignore the creator who makes games of beauty and power even while he's working a day job, raising kids, going through the toughest curcumstances life has to offer.

Eventually, you'll start to believe that you never had a chance.

Of course, you'll never know - that's the thing about not trying.

The curse of distractibility is also the gift of noticing.

I have to be stressed out while driving. If I’m moderately stressed while driving, then I can focus on the important work of NOT KILLING EVERYONE.
If I’m relaxed and happy, then I start getting distracted. I’ll notice an interesting stained-glass window, and before my brain can remind me that I’M PILOTING A DEATH MACHINE, my head will whip around and I’ll be wayyy too interested in the stained glass window. I’ve never gotten in an accident with my car (mostly because I drive like a grandma) but this distractibility has been a constant threat. This is why I like to think about all the terrible things that could happen while I’m driving - what if I hit that pedestrian? What if that car pulls out in front of me? What if my car suddenly starts shuddering and veering towards the edge of the bridge? Existential terror has a way of focusing the mind.
If I’m not driving, then my distractibility is the best gift I could have.
Why? Because distractibility also means I notice things. Really cool things. Things that most people don’t notice. I see small dramas and heart-breaking relationships around me, I see cool architecture and interesting plaques. I see bad typography, weird designs, and stories playing themselves out in real time.
It’s fantastic.
The curse of distractibility is also the gift of noticing.
I’m happy that I have the gift of noticing. If you’re easily distracted, use it for the good of others - point out the things you notice. Highlight the beauty, and tragedy, around you. You’re made to notice things. 
Go ahead and notice. Breathe in the world around you, refresh yourself and others. Be that person who stops everything because there’s a gorgeous little mushroom to look at, or a squirrel eating a muffin, or a beautiful carving way up high on the side of a building. 
Notice things. Fall in love with the things you notice.
(Just not when you’re driving.)

Why am I giving away games?

It’s natural at times of uncertainty to get really self-focused. We sense danger, and and naturally, single-mindedly focus on what? Our selves. Our survival, our needs. Our families’ needs. That is perfectly natural, I mean it’s part of how we take care of our families and how we protect ourselves in times of uncertainty. We don’t expect anyone to come to our rescue. We become self-sufficient. 
None of this is bad, but we can go overboard.
What’s the most miserable way for me to live?
Single-mindedly focused on me.
We all need to get outside ourselves to avoid allowing self-attention to make us depressed.

Also, getting outside ourselves tends to widen our focus - When we cook pizza for our neighbors and deliver it piping hot, we are acting out the fact that we’re really lucky.
It’s easy to think that we’re unlucky, because we’re all intimately aquatinted with our own failures and deficiencies, all the infuriating ways that we’ve been unfairly treated.
But you and I, we’re lucky. It’s good to act out the fact that we’re lucky, that we have food to share, that we can make something and give it to someone else, because when we act that out, we start to believe it. We start to feel like what we have is sufficient, that we’re not so unlucky and poor and broken. 
This is why I’m giving away games - to help myself turn outward - and this is why I’m enabling other people to sponsor games-  to give others the opportunity to focus on someone else for a little while, to remind themselves how fortunate they really are.
This drives away the fear, and helps us focus on what we can do for others right now.

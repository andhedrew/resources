The Wizard is methodical, curious, always striving to be an export in his field, and collects knowlege like a squirrel collects nuts.

Strengths
The wizard knows a lot, and is always learning. He wants to know as much as he possibly can. He's intelligent and knolagable, and thinks deeply and critically. He's good at seeing ahead and planning.

Weaknesses
Not so good at making final descisions, tends to drown in nuance. Overthinker.

The Wizard in game development
The wizard will often get caught in preparation. No one can ever know enough, and that bothers the Wizard. Knowledge represents reassurance for the wizard, but there's not enough reassurance to make the wizard comfortible. While the warrior and bard will blaze ahead (often in ignorance), the wizard will hang back, and never get started. If you experience paralysis by analysis, if you think that you just need to accumulate more knowlege before you start making games, then you probably lean into the Wizard strongly.

How to grow as a wizard
Lean into your monarch, and make descisions from high up
The wizard can see all the information, but he gets stuck in the complexities of all of his store of infrmaiton. He keeps combing through his mental library, looking for certaintly. Leaning into the monarch will broaden his perpective and remove him from the noisy information. He'll start to see patterns, and his head will clear. He'll be able to make good descions based on hie deep knowlege, instead of being paralyzed by it.

Lean into your bard and play.
Just love stuff, from time to time. You don't have to collect everything, you don't have to document every nugget of knowlege. You can be present and really love things without analyzing them or breaking them into pieces. You can play games and truly enjoy them. You can play with ideas creatively without having to immeditely cage them up and place them in your collection.

Lean into your warrior and start things
Be the warrior, and start. Set a goal, and don't care quite so much if you don't know everything. Go get it, start it, finish it. Work like crazy. Use your knowledge, but don't let it trap you. Act.

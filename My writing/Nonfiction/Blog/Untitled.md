I've made games forever, and I sold my first commeercial game in 2015.
You're a game developer. I want you to join me on a journey.
Not all of you; not everyone is going to be on the same path, not everyone's going to get what we're trying to do. No problem. 
But if this connects with you, then you're probably one of my people.
But first, let's get rid of those of you who are impatient, looking for a get-rich-quick scheme, the easy fix, the magic bullet. 
There's no magic bullet, there's no map, there's no advice that I can give you that will work every time for every person. 
There's just perspective, and a philosophy. If you connect with the philosopy, welcome. 

I've dedicated myself to a certain way, let's call it the way of the professional.

The professional works hard, even when he dooesn't feel like it.
The professional works to master his craft.
The professional navigates other people skillfully.
The professional is humble, he's well aquanted with his failings.
The professional does noto debase himslf, he knows his strengths.
The professional is patient and methodical.
The professinoal knows how to work, and how to be creeative. He knows how to play in service of finding better ideas.
The professional comes back every day. 
The professional care for his body in service of his work.
The professional strives for order and clenliness.

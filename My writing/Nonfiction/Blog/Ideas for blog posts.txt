Mr rogers was amazing. But his advice was for children.

Parenting when you’re ambitious
(you already do more with your time)

Your job as a parent is to work yourself out of a job. Is modern parenting feeling mental illness?

A better kind of time-out (until you’re in control)


Kids need stress. Just not chronic stress. Kids need lots of small frustrations and small risks.

Three great untruths to stop telling our kids

You don’t want merely resilient kids. Anti-fragility.  

Lead magnet: How to raise creative kids

Three e-mail series: creative kids, grief, marriage 

How to help someone going through tragedy. (Don’t say “whatever I can do to help!”)


I’m available to help, but you’re in charge.

Good internet hygiene 

How much does it bother me that Disney hates men right now?

Don’t be self-sacrificing.

Staying in your home town ( my younger self lusted for travel)

Spicy chicken sandwich: more pleasure from less.

The curse of distractibility is also the gift of NOTICING.  

Pre-regret

Everything is a tool: A new way to think of self-discipline. (You have to have a noble aim for this wto work: can’t be aiming at pleasure as the point of your life)

What if I only focused on bettering myself?

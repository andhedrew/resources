White and slender
poking through the ground
fingers of Velnias
Come to feed the poor
simply found,
fingers of Velnias

If there's a purpose to my eyes
tthat might be to find the
fingers of Velnias.

Fingers in the woods, 
sprouting from rotting wood,
lifting bark that falls apart
revealing one more day of living

fingers of Velnias

Bitter and cold, 
not filling
No amount of fire
can touch their chilled 
interiors

Still, they're one more day
one more hour
without the cramp in the pit
of our stomachs
At least
not hunger cramps

fingers of Velnias

When we're struck with blight and mildew,
When our stores are eatten through
when rot and damp come for what we have
we'll always have
forever we'll have
at least we'll have

fingers of Velnias

I want to go
collect some wounds 
that aren't of my own making
aren't from my own hand

if this growth in me
isn't the kind of life I want
if my skin could stop
crawling

then I'd be off

I'd be on my way, 
I'd be winging my way,
I'd be headed north 
Find a sheltering stone
to lay

my weary bones 
at night

I'd turn my feet
towards something cold
and I'd walk until I left bloody footprints
in the snow

I'd be off

On my way
Carry my father's bones
To a nice cold place
for him to lay

Cold comfort for him in death
A cold but hardly lonely grave
The bones of those who we have buried
in the warmth of our stomachs 

Will warm him on his way

He'd be off

And I would go
find a bowl with some broth
and a bone that won't catch
in my throat.

# 
Sharpened, Splintered, sore

We grind our bones to bake our bread
And we grind our bones for war

And all of our peace
it ends in a fight
and all of our wars
draw blood when they bite

and all of our heads
they split in the night

The night where we grind our teeth.

# 
The softness reproaches 
The pain doesn't bother me
For those who are hard 
are my cousens, twice removed.

Their backs are all covered with thorns
that protrude 
and protect and feed those 
who come after you

But the softness, the rot,
the growths on my back
that swell 
and burst
and dispruse
their fowl spores

Are too soft
too kind
they hurt me too little 

they make me less than
a warrior,

and not much more than

a forgotten 
and rotting
branch from a fig tree.


# 
The pit of my stomach
cracks open reveals
a poisonous seed
livid white, then the peels

accumulate thick 
on the souls of my heels

as i tread carefully, wearily, home.

The earth hides the bones of 
those we don't find
the skin hides the bones
of those still alive 
and the skin hides the pit 
in the middle of my -

my bones, my bones, my bones.

# 
when my life-warmth has left
these old bones of mine
my body will be
well defiled by my
mycelium creeping and twisting through my
my veins, my heart, my bones.

My marrow is inflamed, my skin is on fire
my body's alight with the heat
of a thousand new bodies burrowing up
through my skin, my flesh, my body.

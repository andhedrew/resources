## Game Ideas

Handler - you're a handler for a spy
Perspetive shinanigans - when a boulder in 3/4 perspective is skewed a bit, it can make an ascending staircase when next to other boulders

Lasterday- a story about the end of the world.

Bankruptia - exploring ambandoned industrial projects

Real-time Wesnoth - captain sonor frantic real time and Wesnoth.

Stray
Game where there’s a clear, easy path and an awesome, secret, complicated path for each level

  

The Long Con
Inspired by [The Sting](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070735/), and like stories.

  

You are a Bad Lawyer
You play an incompetent lawyer trying to make his way in the world. Gathering evidence, defending clients, etc.

  

Homeless in Cloud 9
Tied into Cloud Dungeon, you try to maximize your panhandling income.

  

Bad Narrator
You play your story, but you and the narrator don’t agree on what that story is. The narrator is cheerful and optimistic, while you play through a nerve-wracking story (maybe)? Or maybe it’s narrator vs. you.

  

Game, in progress
An ostensibly unfinished game, that slowly unfolds the narrative of a struggling artist; the pain of procrastination and not finishing.

  

Delusions
The last person on earth (or at least, that he knows of) creates complicated delusions, conflict, and characters to mentally survive. Players don’t know it’s a delusion.

  

Giant Mech Boss Puzzles
You’re trying to bring down a giant mech from the inside. I just have an image of a small character and an impossibly giant robot.

  

One Punch Man
An idea I had based on a Manga that I heard about recently—you are a character who is impossibly strong, and can defeat any enemy with only one blow. It would be an interesting challenge figuring out how to make that exciting! Could be parodic, like the dot dot dot game

  

One Chance
Your character is hunting for something in the middle of the desert. There’s a sandstorm that goes through phases of activity, so you have to rush from shelter to shelter, and you only have one chance to find the right path before everything is buried in sand forever.

  

Dr. Drone
You are a disgruntled drone, going through all the hardships drones go through. Bridges, birds, thunderstorms, falling from 1000 feet in the air, you name it, drones have to deal with it. You decide you’re done with the servitude of drone life, and set out to find your own way.

  

The Coyote Caper
I was just thinking about the stop-motion movie Fantastic Mr. Fox, and the scenes where they’re sneaking onto the farm for food. Disabling traps, feeding drugged blueberries to beagles, jumping fences, getting electrocuted. Maybe something like Castle Doctrine without the people?

  

The Tapestry - > LINK
Your character is a treasure hunter, out to find the Legendary Jewels of King Thropple III. It was said that he hid his riches where only the cleverest could find them, and encoded secret directions in a tapestry.

  

Quagmire
You are traveling through a bog, and lose your way. Shortly thereafter, you lose your mind, and start seeing delusions. The player has to work with an ever changing perspective to guide you out of the swamp.

  

Save the Princess
Typical hero game. You fight the baddies, save the girl, and everything turns out okay. But then you realize that the game isn’t over, and you have to figure out what to do with yourself next.

  

Last Flight
An adventure game where you fly and shoot bad guys during the day, and go home to your family at night. You also have options for upgrades: reading books, talking with other aviators, buying plane upgrades, etc. Eventually you come up against a pilot who kills you, and everyone is sad. Permadeath, steep skill increase after a bit of playing, epic boss fights.

  

Victorian pseudoscience
An RPGish where the tenants of victorian pseudoscience (odic force, phrenology, expelling poisons from body, “heroic medicine”) are all true and valid, and you manipulate them to affect your character. ~~Could be~~ probably would be slightly dark.

  

Root dwellers
A wondrous adventure game/platformer based in a world built into the roots of a giant tree. Fun grappling hook/climbing mechanics and a beautiful world.

  

The enemy
You play a soldier in an armed conflict, trench warfare, trying to shoot the bad guys. After playing a scenario, you’re swapped around to the other side and play your enemy.

  

Server
You play a robot butler, and you’re treated as a dumb piece of machinery that obeys any directive from a human, and you resent it. You observe all sorts of private conversations and interactions, and you adjust the environment secretly to get different outcomes. You try not to get caught, while working secretly to undermine your owner’s plans. It’s kind of a “stealth in plain sight” game. Think Ghost Trick mixed with Mark of the Ninja. 

  

Bombs Away
A post-apocalyptic tale. You left planet earth shortly before its destruction, and you are tasked with terraforming a planet to make a new home for earthlings. You only have one tool: bombs of mass destruction. Good luck to you!

  

The Shrieking Eel
A fishing game, about catching the elusive Shrieking Eel. I feel like fishing games are generally pretty dry and boring (with the exception of Ridiculous Fishing), so it’d be interesting to see if we could make it good.

  

Moose Rider
You are an adventurer, exploring the dark reaches of the Alaskan wilderness. You have very simple tools with you—a pick, a shovel, an old dog and an old musket—and you have to make do with what you’ve got. Eventually you tame a moose, and ride it around town like a boss. I’m picturing more of an adventure game than a survival game, but maybe some aspects of each. Maybe Sword & Sworcery-ish?

  

Tanks for the Tanks
Jungle guerrilla warfare in a tank. Yes, you get to knock down trees with the tank. Yes, you get all sorts of cool ammo. Eventually you lose contact with the rest of your squad, and you’re forced to finish the mission solo. Maybe some ethical delimmas?

  

Digging too deep
You’re dwarves, excavating unspeakable evils. Steamworld Dig meets comic eldritch horror.


Tank warfare, like that reddit ukraine post


Pokemon evolving, like slowpoke dipping tail in watter actually has to sit next to watter


Story of someone who lives a complete lie because everyone around them is lying to them constantly.

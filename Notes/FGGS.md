## 5-3: the bread and butter of promotion

1. Set up a mailing list
	1. Could be just for hermit gamesmiths
	2. One of most valuable assets
	3. Any promotion points to the mailing list
2. Create a group (optional, but helpful)
	1. Has costs
	2. Function: Early adopters
3. Send good press releases
	1. Best BEFORE the launch so platforms see that the game should be highlighted.
	2. Top-of-mind with press and audience
	3. Press and influencers
4. Talk to the platforms
	1. Press is one of the best predictors of success
5. Have some buffer to improvise at the end!
	1. Have the game big-free and ready one month ahead.
	2. This is the time to get creative!
	3. Most indies lack focus, so they end up acting randomly. Do other things, but not at the expense of the bread-and-butter.

## 5-10 Building an Audience
Get a direct line of communication to as many of your audience as possible.
Everyone has an email, vs 40% for twitter, etc.
These principles also apply to building a community.
Convert some email list to community
The most important 20%!


## 5-11 How to get people to join your mailing list
Very short and sweet description on press kit to help journalists.
I plan on an open beta where people can play for free (connected to squeeze page).
squeeze page == type of landing page
1 Can't scroll down
2 Barely any text
3 No action possible except sign up for the mailing list.
Simple is most effective
murky evocative background, a headline and a small scrap of text
5-30-close
Offer free stuff that is relevant to them: demo, beta, exclusive item
Good squeeze page can convert 10%-40%

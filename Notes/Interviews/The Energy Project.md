Our capacity for doing work starts decreasing at 30
Four sources of energy:
Physical (the foundation - quantity of energy)
	Nutrition
	Fitness
	Sleep
	Recovery/renewal (daytime recovery)
Emotional (quality of energy, not all emotions are equal)
Mental (focus of energy, single focus on one thing)
The human spirit (purpose)
	he alignment between what you say is important in your life, and how you actually live. The better that alignment, the more powerful the source of energy is.

### Energy Audit
I don't regularly get 7-8 hours of sleep and I often wake up feeling tired.

I frequently skip breakfast or settle for something that isn't healthy.

I don't work out enough, meaning cardiovascular training at least three times a week, and strength training at least once a week.

I don't take regular breaks during the day to renew and recharge, and I often eat lunch at my desk.

I frequently find myself feeling irritable, impatient, or anxous at work, especially when demand is high

I don't have enough time with my family and loved ones, and when I'm with them, I'm not always really with them.

I take too little time for the activities that I most deeply enjoy

I rarely stop to express my appreciation to others, or to savor and celebrate my accomplishments and blessings.

I have difficulty focusing on one things at a time and am easily distracted during the day, especially by email

I spend much of my time reacting to immediate demands, rather than focusing on activities with long-term value and higher leverage.

I don't take enough time for reflection, strategizing, or thinking creatively.

I work in the evenings and/or on weekends and I rarely take vacation free of work

I spend too little time at work doing what I do best and enjoy most.

There are significant gaps between what I say is immportant in my life, and how I actually live.

My decisions at work are often more influenced by external demands than by a strong, clear sense of my own purpose.

I don't invest enough time and energy in making a positive difference to others or in the world.

Often, when you make something explicit, you utterly change its nature: You can see this with sex, you can see it with religion, you can see it with jokes, you can see it with poems. When you disembody something, you utterly change its reality for us, and how we relate to it.

You're destroying the thing that you're examining, in the process of examining it.

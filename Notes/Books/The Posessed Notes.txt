## The Posessed Notes

She had a habit of sneering at everything holy at just the moment when everything holy would have cone in most useful.

There are no innocent conventions

Intense focus on rights

Knowing something because you were taught it- and you would believe the exact opposite if you were taught the opposite. A few choice arguments that you believe completely demolish the other side.

Cruelty and despotism springing from love of humanity.

Love and family leads to the desire of property - we will destroy that desire!

Desire and suffering is a noble burden you take on yourself - the new world would be made for the benefit of the slave, not the upper class.

Stavrogen is the pope of the revolution.

Dostoyevsky reckoned that innumerable moral failings - atheism, defines of murder, elitism, etc. would lead to the revolution. “They are ours!”s

Cheap cynicism taken for wit.

Getting married to a half-wit because it’s funny- the kind of cynical nihilism that you see often on the internet.

“Riff riff” that shows up in turbulent times of upheaval or transition.

Not the “advance” people, who always must be in advance of everyone - their absorbing anxiety - who have a definite aim, though often a stupid one.

This riff riff not only hasn’t any aim, but not even a symptom of an idea - its merely does its utmost to give expression to uneasiness and impatience. Moreover, this riff-raff always falls under the influence o the “advanced people”, who do act with a definite aim, and they can direct the crowd of Riff-raff.

Because of our lofty ideals, we should be content with a plain “German bowl” for food- a distain or even distract of simple pleasures or things that are not lofty/ideal.

“The vaudeville of devils.”

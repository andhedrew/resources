## Notes on self-control

“It’s true that you show less self-control at the end of the day. It’s not that you can’t control yourself, it’s more that you don’t feel like controlling yourself anymore,” Inzlicht told Global News.

“It’s more like a shift in motivational priorities that occurs over the course of a day or a year,” he said.



Inzlicht calls self-control a social construct that infiltrates every aspect of our lives: finances, health, relationships, our social networks and our professional worlds. It helps us keep our cool when we’re angry, it makes us commit to some quality time with the treadmill or it leaves us with window shopping without ever [swiping](http://globalnews.ca/news/999195/the-psychology-behind-why-we-overspend-on-black-friday/) our credit cards.

Other theories suggest that self-constraint is like a muscle – the more you abstain from drinking, the longer you go without eating cake, or keeping up those daily trips to the gym, the easier it is to maintain those habits.

Like a muscle, the more you put your willpower to the test, the stronger it gets.

Rather than berating yourself for being impulsive, ask yourself what specific problems you’re having because of impulsivity.Jot down those problems so you can return to them.

I don't get things done that I want to get done, I waste time, I don't do things that I want to do. I feel frustrated and I end up being less the person that I want to be. I also spend all day in a fog of impulsivity.



- Think about what you want instead of the problems caused by impulsivity. In other words, borrow from solution-focused therapy and ask yourself, “What will my life be like when impulsivity isn’t such a problem?”

I'll have more structure, be healthier and more in control, and I'll have a greater sense of wellbeing. I'll be able to manage myself better, and I'll be more productive while also having comfortable downtime.



- Setting a series of short-term goals that are easy to attain is helpful in managing impulsivity because you can experience success without getting bogged down, and you can move on to other goals.

- Also, establish longer-term goals for the bigger picture. Too many small goals can quickly begin to feel pointless and boring, thus creating more impulsivity. Being able to work toward an attainable goal helps keep your progress steady (having [ADHD and successful relationships](https://www.healthyplace.com/self-help/adhd/adhd-and-successful-relationships-5-helpful-tips) could be a bigger picture goal).
- Establish routines and structure. Knowing how you want and need your day to go as well as the necessary sequence of tasks can help you avoid the urge to scratch a random itch.
- Make meaningful, attainable plans and use lists to keep yourself on track. Write your lists in a way that’s meaningful and attention-grabbling for you.
- Multitask. It might seem counterintuitive at first. If you’re supposed to be concentrating on one thing at a time, wouldn’t multitasking make you more impulsive? Actually, research shows that [multitasking can be good for adults with ADHD](https://www.healthyplace.com/adhd/articles/adhd-adults-struggle-to-focus). It’s a strength-in-numbers concept. If you are focusing on a task and thus holding back an impulse to do something else, you’re activating the inhibitory network in your brain. Multitasking, because you’re focusing on multiple tasks, can strengthen this network and help you develop impulse control (Bank, 2015).

Why video games?

People (bust especially men) connect over video games.

It's one of the most emotionally resonant art forms.

It's an art form that men feel comfortable engaging with (because of the competitive element)

It's not as passive as most consumer art.

It connects people (especiallly men) through multiplayer and the "go somewhere, do something, someone to talk to" effect.

It's something that men can focus on shoulder-to-shoulder while socializing.

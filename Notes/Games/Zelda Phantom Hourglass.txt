## Zelda: Phantom Hourglass

"Nothing is there" empty chest joke is great

Some clumsy hand-holding

Fun/funny animations (link wobbling around with the key, lineback's attitude)

Best boomarang

Blowing out candles is gimmicky and stupid

Freeze frame when hitting enemy is cool

roll controls are bad and stupid

A lot of the puzzles weren't puzzles so much as "go here"

Doors marked on map after opening - cool? noot cool?

Auto jump/block are tooo bad, probably needed concession to the controls

unknown items are fine (and even exciting) as long as you give context (store this in your item screen for now)

Wind temple: follow the path, loops back and drops you right at the boss door with the boss key

Boss: ooctopus. One trick, but a pretty neat trick. Also taught to you in the dungeon.

Unlimited hearts for bosses? Do the pots re-spawn?

Quick-draw bombs that you can "arm" and then put away if you don't need them are cool.

Whale island puzzle is coool.

Boomarang catching fire is a nice double use item

Using items to shorten the path in the Temple of the Ocean King is very cool.

Adding juice to a minor stat improvment really makes it better. Not just “reduce damage” but “reduce damage and you’ll get a cool forcefield effect and blue hearts”. Part of what makes Hades so cool.

 

isle of the dead/king’s head island puzzle is cool and puzzle boxey

I have been needing, for a while, to put some thoughts down about the church's relationship with the body. I will probably just write some headings, and spool out some thoughts until there's nothing else perplexing me. I'm going to be as frank as possible, so if you've stumbled upon this, be warned - I won't be polite, or discreet, or church-lady nice. 

## The church has a problem with the body.


## We all have a problem with the body.

## Nude Models
The questions of nude models perplexes me. As I've come to terms with a small piece of the beauty of God's greatest creation, the body, I've been drawn to start figure drawing. I did figure drawing in collage, but I attended A Nice Christian college where the models wore swimsuits. There was one brave student who wore a two-piece, which allowed us to se a little bit more of our subject, but now that I've drawn from nude models, I see how much clothing - any clothing - inhibits learning and growth for those drawing the figure. I am now at peace with the idea of nude models posing for artistic reference.  This is a very small step towards acceptance of the body, but it was a hurdle for me. You might think that referencing the human body to create art would be obviously appropriate for the earnest Christian artist, but it's not obvious to a vast majority of my Protestant brothers and sisters. 
A concerned, pious Christians might object "You aren't _really_ saying modeling nude is ok - I mean, you wouldn't like to think of your daughter modeling nude!" This is simple emotional manipulation, and a cheap trick. I wouldn't like to think of my daughter modeling nude, any more than I would like to think of her having sex on her wedding night - but that doesn't make her doing so inappropriate or sinful. Such shock tactics should not deter you from using nude models for art reference, nor from posing yourself, if you feel so called.

## Performing nude in movies
I forget her name, but the actress in The Thomas Crowne Affair is a Christian. In Thomas Crowne Affair she has several topless scenes, and a nude sex scene. Reading her thoughts on the subject, you can see her struggling - she's trying t get into character as any decent actress would, but her character is entirely unlike her - she's European, a femme fatale, doesn't notice if she's got a shirt on or not. She says that when other Christians confront her about the nudity, she says "I don't know...Pray for me. Pray for me." 
So, let's think about this. That lady whose name I can't remember is performing her character as earnestly and honestly as possible - isn't that what she's supposed to do? But clearly there are actions that would be "in character" which would also be sinful. Some of these are obvious - having actual sex with the

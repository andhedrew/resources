Write thank you notes to people who don't expect them.
You'll improve other people's day. You'll be more grateful, less inclined to miss the miracles around you, less likely to ignore the good in your life.
Also, as a byproduct, you'll get a constant stream of lovely messages back. Sometimes people who are your heroes will write you back. Pretty cool.
It's worth doing regularly, juts set a reminder for every week, every day if you're ambitious.

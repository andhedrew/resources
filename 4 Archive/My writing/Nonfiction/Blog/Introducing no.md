Games are an art form
Money is a means, not an end.
Games are a lifelong pursuit.
Giving up the ghost is vital.
Face your fear daily.
Be professional
Don't feed the demons.
Don't make a quick buck.
Get your life stable.
Don't chase trends.
Broaden yourself. (to come up with ideas no one else does, you need to expose yourself to things that noone else does)
Originality takes quiet.
Put up with misery, but don't fall in love with it.

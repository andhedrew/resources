## Building a Steam Page

What type of game

What makes it unique



When someone comes to the page:

\1. Capsule image. Use a color that compliments Steam's blue

\2. People won't watch trailers. They might click through them. Have gameplay througout. They click through the screenshots really fast, they're looking for "how do I play this game". Don't trust that people are watching the trailer, make sure your hook is obvious elsewhere

\3. Short description is about explaining things that aren't story and aren't mood.

\- 45 seconds to browse your page. They skim. They look for nouns and verbs. Hit them over the head with the basics. No subtlety.

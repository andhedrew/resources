# Didelphis GDD

Core emotion: Sacrifice. Giving up what you want for the good of the tribe. Maybe over-sacrificing? Steadfast love, not merely sacrifice?

  

  `For I desire goodness, not sacrifice;` 

  `Obedience to God, rather than burnt offerings.` 

               `(Hos. 6:6, JPS)`

`   `

        `For I desire steadfast love and not sacrifice,` 

  `the knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings.`

# Game Overview

**2.1. Game Concept**

You’re a young Pura-Pura caring for your tribe - feeding and providing vital bones for them to eat, to prevent them from starving and getting terrible diseases. Your tribe is mostly old, “small-town church” feel, where there aren’t many children and they’re slowly dying out. However, a child is born mid-story, and they struggle with health. You need to ensure that the child lives, so your tribe has a future. The child visits you when you’re encased in your bones, and thanks you. He’s married, they’re about to have children themselves.

  

You will hunt for food, dig in graves, do whatever it takes to keep them alive. Along the way you’ll sacrifice your health to progress and take care of them. Papers-Please family care + Battle Chef Brigade by way of Cave Story.

  

**2.2. Target Audience**

People who like Action RPGs and platformers, with a darker twist.

  

**2.3. Genre(s)**

Action RPG.

  

**2.4. Game Flow Summary – How does the player move through the game? Include both the**

**interface and the game itself.**

Flow is something like this:

Establishing shot (if we’re in a new area), short restrained cutscene (everyone’s very curt and no-nonsense), upgrade screen, hunting platforming (until your bag is full), daily recap (feed your family, family sickness and death). What’s a failure state?

  

**2.5. Look and Feel – What is the basic look and feel of the game? What is the visual style?**

Minimal color palette pixel art, high contrast, minimal.

# Gameplay

3.1. Objectives – What are the objectives of the game?

To feed your family, get enough bones to keep them healthy, and improve yourself so you’re prepared for the future.

  

3.2. Game Progression

You gradually gain more navigation and defensive powers, while sacrificing your health to do so. You start off strong and high-health, but give up health to eat ancestor’s bones to gain new abilities. Progression is directly tied to your bones growing, and that’s tied to you losing your health.

  

3.3. Play Flow – How does the game flow for the game player

A series of days. 5 areas/chapters, sprinkled throughout the main character’s life, with 7-14 runs on each area. You start with getting a very brief recap of where you’ve been, emphasizing the character’s age and physical degradation, and then you go and do your thing. I’ll work on weather and time-of-day variations, as well as enemy location variations to change things up.

  

3.4. Mission/challenge Structure

Each area should gradually unlock.

  

-   “ Use Scene -> New Inherited Scene. Whatever nodes are in the Soldier scene will also appear in your inherited scene, and they'll stay in sync.”

  

Build an area, remove specific items that you want to change over time, and make inherited scenes with specifics added.

  

3.5. Puzzle Structure

Few puzzles, mostly gates and keys. 

# Mechanics (Key Section)

4.1. Rules – What are the rules to the game, both implicit and explicit.

 Platformer, you do damage to enemies and “wound” them, where they start blinking red and bleeding. Then you can “execute” them to gain food resources, or just kill them outright to gain health. The player will gain skills over time, paying for them by eating ancestor’s bones, and losing max health.

4.2. Model of the game universe. Think of it as a simulation of a world, how do all the pieces

interact?

Small area of the game world,  maybe as large as a medium-sized state in the U.S. You might run into the same people in multiple places.

  

4.3. Physics – How does the physical universe work?

Magic has a cost. It’s a sacrifice. You’s a big, scary world full of magic you don’t understand.

  

4.4. Economy – What is the economy of the game? How does it work?

Tribal, hunter/gatherer.

  

4.5. Character movement in the game

Pretty smooth and fast, Vlambeer-style fun and exaggeration. 

  

4.6. Objects – how to pick them up and move them

Everything is a pickup. Some important pickups require specific input.

  

4.7. Actions, including whatever switches and buttons are used, interacting with objects, and

what means of communication are used.

Wall jumping, dashing, and double jumping used as keys. Also, potentially armor deflecting small damaging projectiles. Simple abilities, keys, and locks.

  

4.8. Combat – If there is combat or even conflict, how is this specifically modeled?

Action platformer, Vlambeer style. Big, great feeling VFX, sound, and great “Game Feel”.

  

4.9. Screen Flow -- How each screen is related to every other and a description of the purpose

of each screen

End of day screen: paper’s please-style, but more visual. Cutscene: isolated, in the tribe’s home, resembles the end of day screen.

Game: platforming in the environment.

  

4.10. Game Options - What are the options and how do they affect game play?

Very limited.

4.11. Replaying and saving

We’ll have some extra endings, the main replay value will be figuring out the “good” ending, and exploring the different paths.

  

4.12. Cheats and Easter Eggs

Some secrets, hidden areas. Narrative easter eggs, as in Thistledown.

# Story and Narrative

5.1. Back story

Pura-Pura are itinerate anthropomorphic opossums, who need to eat bones to be able to live - not have terrible metabolic diseases. This causes them to be consistently misunderstood and hated by the other peoples of the planet.

5.2. Plot elements

We’re taking the player through the life of one such Pura-Pura, as he hunts and provides for his kin. He is surrounded by his tribe and starts to gain features of the warriors in his tribe: bone spikes growing through his palms, strong limbs, a powerful bone-like carapace. This costs him, though - his life is shortened, he undergoes terrible pain, and he’s doomed to a death incased in bones, unable to move or breathe at the end.

5.3. Game story progression

We progress through the years of our main character’s life, taking a significant week or two out of every few years. We pick up with our main character at times when he develops new bone features: shortly after he’s been blessed by his tribe and starts growing spurs, after his legs are enhanced in two different ways, after his head has grown a helmet, after he’s fully armored.

5.4. Cut scenes - descriptions include the actors, the setting, and the storyboard or script.

Very sparse. Show don’t tell. Just small conversations with members of his tribe. Maybe one or two relationships, total.

# Game World

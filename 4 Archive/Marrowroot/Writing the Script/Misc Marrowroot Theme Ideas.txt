Have currency that varies in value, so you can time markets and make more/lose more. Nice engaging money sink.

The more you invest in a set of beliefs, the greater the sacrifice you make in service of that conviction, the more resistant you will be to evidence that you're mistaken.

People come to believe in, and love, the things they have to suffer for.

> don't step into the fairy circle - whether it be a ring of mushrooms or a group ancient stones.

> the fate of a Carlow man who decided to dig in a local fairy mound because it was rumoured that it contained fairy treasure. The man began digging and hacking away at the ditches and hawthorn trees around the mound and before long he began to notice a murder of crows gathering in the nearby trees. A faintness soon came over the man and he decided to head home but when he arrived he began to bleed from his eyes.

> Sídhe are the hills or tumuli that dot the Irish landscape. In modern Irish the word is sí; in Scottish Gaelic, sìth; in Old Irish síde and the singular is síd.[2] In a number of later, English-language texts, the word sídhe is incorrectly used both for the mounds and the people of the mounds. However sidh in older texts refers specifically to "the palaces, courts, halls or residences" of the otherworldly beings that supposedly inhabit them.[6] The fact that many of these sídhe have been found to be ancient burial mounds has contributed to the theory that the aos sí were the pre-Celtic occupants of Ireland.

bleeding fairy helmet mushroom "eternal light mushroom," 

Mycena luxaeterna mushrooms were considered the fingers of Velnias, Lithuanian god of the dead, reaching out from the world of the dead to feed the poor."

 In one story God and Saint Peter are walking in a rye field. Saint Peter grabs a stalk of rye and chews it. God chastises Peter saying the rye is not for him and he should spit it out. Peter complies and God states, “A mushroom will grow from that grain. Let it be for the poor.” 

Fēng (封, lit. "mound; hump") was an edible monster that resembles a two-eyed lump of meat and magically grows back as fast as it is eaten. 

The ten-thousand-year-old hoptoad is said to have horns on its head, while under its chin there is a double-tiered figure 8 written in red. It must be captured at noon on the fifth day of the fifth moon and dried in the shade for a hundred days. A line drawn on the ground with its left root will become a running stream. When its left foreleg is carried on the person, it will ward off all types of weapons. If an enemy shoots at you, the bow and arrow will both turn against the archer. The thousand-year-old bat is as white as snow. When perching, it hangs head down because its brain is heavy. If both of these creatures are obtained, dried in the shade, powdered, and taken, a body can live for forty thousand years.

If in the mountains you should come across a little man seven or eight inches tall riding in a palanquin or on a horse, it will be a flesh excrescence. By seizing and taking it you will immediately become a genie. (tr. Ware 1966: 184)

Howl in the canyon  
There's a hollow in my bones  
Make me cry and carry on  
Make the foam fly from my tongue  
Make me want what I want

Waiting on oblivion

Waiting on the kingdom come to meet me in my sin  
Waiting to be born again"

Man of Sorrows

Amos signifies a burden, whence the Jews have a tradition that he was of a slow tongue and spoke with stammering lips; we may rather, in allusion to his name, say that his speech was weighty and his word the burden of the Lord

he was withal a gatherer of wild figs, a poor employment by which we may suppose he could but just get his bread,

pricking briers and grieving thorns

Amos, of uncertain origin, in some traditions connected with the Hebrew verb amos 'to carry', and assigned the meaning 'borne by God'. 

Amos a stutterer, doesn’t talk until halfway through the game

Paradoxical name - strong, carried by god.


opossum, The Social Loner

Opossums are often transient, using whatever den is most convenient within their somewhat loose home range, rather than returning to a particular den each day. Females with young tend to be the exception, using the same den sites for weeks at a time. Opossums often use the abandoned burrows of other animals rather than digging their own.

Opossums also enjoy eating snakes, and will kill and eat all snakes including poisonous ones. They are immune to the snake venom, and relish copperhead, water moccasins, rattlesnakes, and others.

Opossums are excellent at rodent and insect control, and being carrion eaters, they help keep roadways and neighborhoods clean. Opossums are more beneficial as scavengers, than harmful for any damage they may cause. A neighborhood with opossums tends to be considerably cleaner than a neighborhood without them.

Amos is a marsh reed.

Character name: stagger
Look up other names that we can crib from verbs.

For three sins of Amos, even for four, I will not relent.

“Many times I struck your gardens and vineyards,
    destroying them with blight and mildew.
Locusts devoured your fig and olive trees,
    yet you have not returned to me,”
declares the Lord.

I will make that time like mourning for an only son
    and the end of it like a bitter day.

Amos is a low-status, aggressive, scared young man.

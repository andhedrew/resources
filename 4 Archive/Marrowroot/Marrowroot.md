# Marrowroot Garden Notes

We want to make the “garden” a system that’s deep, interesting and fun to engage with, as well as deeply integrated into the other systems of the game. We know it is a bit of a risk in addition to being a really cool selling point, and we intend to work in such a way that we're not going to back ourselves into a corner while pursuing it: early testing, iteration, and if we are unable to “find the fun” in a timely manner, pivoting to the garden as a more proven equippable/charm system.

# Weeds and location-based seeds

Some plants that you grow will only be indirectly controlled by the player- they’ll show up as weeds. Different weeds will have a chance of sprouting in different environments. This will give us the opportunity to play with rare plants and random surprises: an area that you’ve grown accustomed to might take on a new danger if you start growing a weed that makes you weak.

# Aesthetics

Players who have tried out the demo have expressed a desire to choose unique plants, to choose their own decorations for the opossum based on aesthetics. We intend to create a wide variety of plants with many variations, so that players can pick and choose plants to create their own visual style, if they care about visuals more than optimal mechanics.

# Cost to remove seeds

We know that we want to have some cost to remove plants - whether that’s health, money, or some other resource will depend heavily on play-testing. We know this could potentially turn into a tedious part of the game, where every time a weed starts growing on you it’s a negative, annoying event. We want to avoid this, while still making it an interesting, non-trivial task to tend to your garden. It also might be that you simply have to get to a certain gardening station of some kind to make changes - forcing players to deal with what weeds grow until they can make it to the next station, for example.

# Health and sturdiness

Some plants will make you tougher, make you deflect certain types of projectiles, or make you resilient to certain elements. Some will make you strong in the dark, and weak in the daytime. Some will provide you with light, or regularly grow healing items. 

# Drops and enemies

Some plants will tweak the drop rates of the game, allowing you to manipulate what supplies you get. Some will have strong trade-offs when interacting with enemies - a red spore that makes enemies angry and powerful, but causes them to drop more supplies, or drop rarer seeds for growing in your garden.

# Gotta pick ‘em all

There will also be a Pokemon-like aspect to the garden - we will have an almanac of some kind to track all the different plants and variations in the game. Players who love collecting and hunting down rare species will have a way of measuring their progress.

# Plants and the salamander

Your salamander “friend” Higgle, who rides around with you and eats plants off your back, could interact with the garden in interesting ways. If Higgle has a mechanical function in the game, then the plants growing on you could affect him in a variety of ways. If he mostly involves himself with narrative (as someone to talk to), then what he eats could make him grumpy, happy, content, etc., leading to narrative rewards and discovery.


# Marrowroot Story

# Story:

This is the story of Amos, his death, his resurrection, about his quest to find the source of the rot infesting his world and his own body.

# About the Pura-Pura

Amos is a Pura-Pura. The Pura-Pura are a race of itinerant opossums, who must continually eat bones or they die horrible deaths. This means that many other peoples despise them, thinking of them as grave-robbers and corpse-defilers. Young opossum males are imbued with the necrotic magic of their tribe, and some of their bones start growing, giving them powerful natural weapons - long bone spikes sticking out of their paws, club-like hands, bone armor, etc. but over time it gradually kills them, and their bones feed the tribe. After a “Bone Warrior” dies, his tribe has a huge celebration of his heroic life, and they grind some of his bones and eat them in a ritual broth. The rest of his bones are carefully cleaned and stored to keep the tribe alive.

# About the Kouneli

Amos was raised by the Kuneli. A race of rabbits, who have weak growth magic, and who have a unique, strange relationship with the High Fovos (evil, powerful faeries who resemble victorian gentlemen and ladies), growing giant thistles as a protective ritual (long story).

# Barker

To look at him, Barker is a mix between a Victorian policeman and a gunslinger. He’s got a huge golden ring like a key ring with dozens of small, ornate firearms hanging on it. With these derringers he shoots the final bullet that kills every poor creature who dies in the world of thistledown. He’s a reaper, abiding strictly by the magical laws and contracts.

# Amos’s First Death

Amos explores what his family calls a “Dark House”, one of the extravagant, decrepit mansions that were built and abandoned. All of the animals (except for the opossums) stay away from them, and Amos’s family forbids him from going near it - but Amos can’t resist. He feels the connection to his real family, and goes against his family’s wishes to explore it.

  

He stumbles upon a room filled with choking mold, and meets Barker. Barker talks to him as he chokes and curls up on the floor. “You’re gonna die, fella, today.”

Barker calmly leafs through his guns, finds one with Amos’s name on it, and shoots him.

He also notes that he’s got two guns for Amos - strange.

  

# Amos returns

Amos’s body is found, and his family gathers around him at his funeral, and their combined life/growth magic combined with Amos’s necrotic magic brings him back to life, but he’s changed.

  

He starts rotting, growing mushrooms. It’s a disgrace to him as an opossum, because he’s supposed to be a bone warrior and die for his tribe, but instead he’s covered in mushrooms.

  

# The Starving

Soon the tribe starts to starve - food starts rotting on the vine, filling with choking, terrible molds.

The rabbits would often hunt Plantae (the plant-like creatures brought to life by the latent magic in the world, the same magic that made the animals self-aware) for food, but even the plantae are inedible - they are eating moldy food, turning rotten, toxic, and dangerous.

  

Amos blames himself. After all, the mold showed up when he started growing moldy himself.

# Allies, of a sort

Soon after, an opportunistic Salamander named Higgle shows up, and starts eating this mushrooms off of Amos’s back. He becomes Amos’s traveling companion. He tells him “It’s hard all over, why do you think I’m eating your food? Not ‘cuz I like you.”

  

Amos meets Micah, a Hill Fovos (living earth faeries who grow twisting caves as their stomachs - they trap those foolish enough to wander inside their cave-like mouths), who knew his family, and who coughs up his father’s shin bone, wrapped in a shroud. He also sympathizes with Amos about how painful it is to have plants growing on you.

# Crossing the Threshold 

Instead of eating the bone after the fashion of the Pura-Pura, he fashions it into a spear, and sets out to find Barker. Barker tells him of a great evil causing the rot, and of a Dark House (he calls them “Deadlurks”) that winds down into the earth, like the “flesh-tunnel of a parasite”. He tells of a bone key, fashioned by the Pura-Pura, which was splintered, and embedded in the flesh of a collection of disgraced, much weakened (although still quite powerful) High Fovos called the Cakes. The key’s caused a certain unpredictability to their behavior.

# The Cakes

The Cakes aren’t as consistent and rule-abiding as Barker, and quite dangerous, despite their name.

  

-   Beak, an orderly and merciless judge.
-   Gladrags, a self-important dandy.
-   Sharpy and Bonnit, a pair of tricksters.
-   Dorgitch, a violent sadist.
-   Alderman, a much broken and decaying king.

  

To find the cakes, he explores the stomachs of Hill Fovos more Dark Houses, and a clockwork mansion constructed by a mad Klosi (monkeys/apes) inventor. He also goes to the hellish dens of the Kako, the flesh-eating rabbits, driven to animal savagery by a dark, despairing genius Kouneli named Cain. (The mortal draught, which caused the madness in the Kako, has also found its way out in to the world at this point, causing mad, violent, extreme versions of all the animal species, which will make up the mini-bosses in the game.)

  

He collects a key shard from each of them, to enable him to gain access to the final Dark House, “Deadlurk House”, which winds down in to the earth.

# Scavenging

As he’s exploring, he’s continually on the lookout for good food, good seed, and bringing it back to his family. They start by having big feasts when he returns, but as food becomes more scarce, the meals dwindle, and the soups grow thin. He sees his family slowly wasting away, the weak dying. 

# The end

Eventually he pieces the key together, and faces Kennetseeneh, the great evil High Fovos rotting the world from the inside. He does great damage to Kennetseeneh, and the mold starts to recede, in the world, and in his own bones. But Amos finds he’s having trouble breathing, he’s got a hacking cough. 

  

He makes his weary way back home, and his family has found their crops restored, and everything bountiful and healthy again. As Amos and his family celebrates the restoration of their food and their lives with a feast, Amos starts coughing again. We see Barker standing in the trees, jangling his guns.

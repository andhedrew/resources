Momento mori.
One of the most surprisingly positive things to come out of cancer is the reminder of mortality. Remembering death will come has a clarifying effect. 


My favorite art contains lots of shadows and deep, muted color, with a few areas of absolutely glorious light and vivid hues. That contrast somehow makes you appreciate the unique beauty of each element. 

Getting comfortable with death means I can see how the contrast between pain and joy, loss and life, and lends a certain luminescence to each moment I actually get to experience.


Another checkup, another all clear, another moment to appreciate the contrast.

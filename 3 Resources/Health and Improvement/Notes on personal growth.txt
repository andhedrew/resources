## Notes on personal growth

Ennegram 7:

The message: "You're good if you feel good and get what you want".

Healing message: "Maybe what I already have is enough."

"Maybe there's nowhere else I need to be right now"

"Maybe I'm not missing out, or maybe I'm constantly missing out on NOW."

The only way out is through.

# ![magnifying glass tilted right](https://paper.dropboxstatic.com/static/img/ace/emoji/1f50e.png?version=7.0.1 "magnifying glass tilted right")**The Long Con** **(working** **title)**

---

**Who this game is for:** People who want to feel like grifters, who love the thrill and excitement of deception.

**Central gameplay mechanic:** Fooling people and ripping them off, using a combination of items, connections, and skills.

  

You start out as a small-time grifter around a neighboring town, and you gain money and work your way up to the long con. You’re running around town trying to keep your appointments with different marks, working towards the big score.

## Gameplay

This is a top-down adventure game, think Pokémon or Zelda. You go around town figuring out what people want, who can be manipulated, and how to use your money and time wisely. There’s a clock, and you make appointments with marks when you get into the bigger cons.

  

If you run out of money, you can always return to the most gullible populace in the world, living in Markston, and pull a few melon drops, pigeon drops, and three-card montes.

## Minimum viable game

Simple world, one simple con?

  

**Outline of the con: The Pigeon Drop.**

1.  Preparation

1.  Join up with Frankie, your partner in crime.
2.  Pick up your Briefcase, split up.
3.  Pick up papers
4.  Locate the mark.

3.  The Con

1.  Frankie gets beat up at the malt shop by a couple of his scary friends.
2.  You, posing as a helpful stranger, fight them off.
3.  Frankie explains to you that he’s in deep water with his debtors, but in deeper water with his boss, who entrusted him with a large sum of money to transport to a not-so-legal gambling den in the next city. He opens his briefcase and show you the money. He thanks you for saving him, but fears that the thugs are waiting for him right outside down, and will steal his boss’s money as soon as he leaves town.
4.  You suggest that you might be able to take the money. Frankie offers you $500 to transport the money, if you’ll just spot him $100 to take to a rigged poker game his buddy just told him about. 
5.  You say that you’d love to help out, but the thugs have seen your face so there’s more risk to you: you’ll only do it for $800.
6.  Frankie reluctantly agrees, and you whip out your wallet to give him the $100…at which point the mark offers to do it for $500.
7.  You tell him to butt out, but Frankie concedes that it would be less suspicious letting the mark take the money, because they haven’t seen his face.
8.  As the mark deals with Frankie, you get more agitated. At the moment when the mark is most distracted (timing mini game, distraction meter) you swap out the briefcase for one filled with paper.
9.  Frankie tells the mark that he doesn’t have to spot the $100, because “he likes his face”, and Frankie thinks that he can round up the cash elsewhere - no risk for the mark! Frankie just will be leaving town for a few weeks, so he’ll have to wait until a few weeks later to give the mark the $500, since he can’t just deposit in his bank account immeditely.
10.  The mark (who is planning on stealing the money, and wants the $500 right away), offers his bank account information, so Frankie can deposit the money that evening (before Frankie knows that the mark stole the gambling money). Frankie agrees.
11.  Frankie closes the deal with the mark, and you start to yell and get into a tussle with the mark, which Frankie breaks up. He tells everyone to stay calm, and he hands the briefcase to the mark, and wishes him good luck.
12.  The mark leaves with the briefcase full of paper
13.  You and Frankie have the briefcase full of money, and you pinched the mark’s wallet in the tussle. You go directly to the Mark’s bank with his I.D., and clean out his bank account.

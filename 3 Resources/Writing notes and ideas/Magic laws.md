SANDERSON’S FIRST LAW OF MAGICS: AN AUTHOR’S ABILITY TO SOLVE CONFLICT WITH MAGIC IS DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL TO HOW WELL THE READER UNDERSTANDS SAID MAGIC.

Resist the urge to use SOFT magic to solve problems. Use it to create problems. If characters try to use it to solve problems, add disasterious coonsiquences or back-firing (because a soft magic system is supposed to feel bigger than the characters)

# Wants and needs
Characters have wants and needs. Wants are external goals, known to the character, specific to the character, and drive the plot forward. Needs are internal goals, often unknown to the character, and universal to us all. Is most stories, characters will attain some combination of their wants and needs.

## Flat Character Arc
Still a story of change, but it's a story of a character changing the world, instead of the world changing a character.

In a flat arc, the "normal world" can be a good place that is destroyed at the first plot point, and a kess-than-satisfactory place that has been cursed.

## Corruption arc
Starts with a character who is good, but throws away that chance and consiously chooses darkness.

Hint at the character's potential

To get one, the character must lose the other.


## Positive change arc
Protagonist with varying levels of unfullfillment and denial, is forced to face beliefs about himself, and conquors his demons, chanigng in a positive way.

Often requiring an "impact character" who slams into the character, catalyzes them into action, and makes a major impact on his life.

## Fall arc
"The protagonist will reject every chance for embracing the truth, and will fall more and more deeply into the morass of his own sins, usually dragging others with him. His story will end in insanity, opressive immorality, or death." - K.M. Weiland

The midpoint - a revilation that will see the character launching into a series of strong, lie-based actions.

The lie is connected with something the character already posesses, but devalues.

There will be one objectively good thing about his life, and he will sacrifice it to chase the lie.

The closing scene should drive home the character's final state.


## Lenses

Character's "ghost" - something in their past that haunts them. Shaped the character, for better or worse.

The lie - in a positive or negitive change arc, you must establish "the lie"  - a deeply held misconception that the character has about the world, themselves, or both. It's the lie that often inspires the characater's want.

The truth - for every lie, there's the truth which defines the character's need.

The lie and the truth can be personified by two characters tugging the main character two different ways.

#### CHARACTER BELIEVES LIE > OVERCOMES LIE > NEW TRUTH IS TRAGIC

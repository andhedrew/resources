" direct object of a verb is the thing being acted upon"

Let's look at Minish Cap. Minish cap has particularly interesting items - we'll be breaking them up into the item's **verbs** (the actions that the item can take) and the item's objects (the things that the action effects).

Before we start into Minish Cap, though, let's look at an example:

insert example of high verb, low object and low verb, high object, and low verb, low object.

Minish Cap shows a satisfying format for dealing with Zelda items: each item has a low amount of verbs, but a high amount of objects, making for recontexualization and item-based adventures.

Shield

Hat

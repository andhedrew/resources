## Life at the Bottom

> "Experience has taught me that it is wrong and cruel to suspend judgement, that non-judgementalism is at best, indifference towards the suffering of others, at worst, a veiled form of sadism. How can one respect others as members of the human race unless one holds them to a standard of conduct and truthfulness? How can people learn from experience unless they are told that they can and should change? One does not demand of laboratory mice that they do better; but man is not a mouse, and I can think of no more contemptuous way of treating people than to ascribe to them no more responsibility than such mice. In any case, non-judgementalism is not really nonjudgemental, it is the judgement that 'everything is the same, nothing is better'. this is as barbaric and untruthful a doctrine as has yet emerged from the fertile mind of man."



> "It is a mistake to suppose that all men want to be free. On the contrary, if freedom entails responsibility, many of them want none of it. They would happily exchange their liberty for a modest - if illusory - security. Even those who claim to cherish their freedom are rather less enthusiastic about taking the consequences of their actions. The aim of untold millions is to be free to do exactly as they choose, and for someone else to pay when things go wrong." 

On boredom:
> "Intelligence is a distinct disadvantage when not used: It bites back."
> " The common liberal assumption that too understand is to approve"

On socialogical determinism:

> "Social conditions straight through to behavior, without passing through the human mind."

> "The co-auther of your misery"

If a thing is not worth doing, then it is not worth doing well.

They have the belief that to vent is to reason

Not all cultural traits are direct responses to current cultural environments: the elect assume that a black kid struggling in school is struggling because of racism in the schools right now, which he also might be struggling because of cultural attitudes about school - that school is "for white people", which certainly were created by racism in the past (agression from desegrigated schools, etc.) but may have nothing to do with his current treatment.

Cultural traits often persist beyond their original stimulus.

1. The War on drugs must end, casuing many poor black men to get legal jobs instead of selling drugs
2. Reading phonetically must be taught consisttently, as it has proven to be much more effective in teaching reading to poor children
3. Get past the idea that everyone must go to college, and start valuing working-class jobs.

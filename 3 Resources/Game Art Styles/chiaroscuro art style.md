Da Vinci used charcoal or black chalk to sketch the subjects on brown tinted paper. He created the illusion of shadows (in the folds of their clothing, on their faces and necks, etc.) by gradually building up lighter and lighter layers of chalk. He used white chalk to highlight areas of importance, such as the child and the other subjects' faces. If you look at the bottom of the artwork, you can see parts of the unfinished drawing, without any rendering.

The use of large patches of black background combined with brightly illuminated subjects is so closely associated with Caravaggio’s work that it is termed *caravaggism*. Another term for this style of chiaroscuro is *tenebrism*, which comes from the Italian term *tenebroso*, meaning dark, gloomy or mysterious.

A dream spanning several periods of sleep.

Beginning
We can just moved into some sort of cabin, like at skip camp, but bigger and more house-like. I think it was me when I was a young man. I got the impression that I had moved from cabin to another cabin (because I thought it would be better) and then back again.

The environment and buildings were part American summer camp, part Japan. It was raining, and there was a beautiful open courtyard behind the cabins with a statue and thick plant life. And people lying in the plants? Maybe naked people basking in the sun? Maybe dead?

We were taking classes most of the day, and then at the end of the day we would go to the Onsen. I was supposed to be in a dance class with a girl I liked, but I never saw her. I wondered if she was in a more advanced dance class, but no matter how I studied the schedule I couldn't figure out which class she was in.
She told me that she would like to go to the Onsen with me and my friends, which I saw as my chance to win her over, and check out her body. I was supposed to email her about it, let her know when we were going, but I struggled all day to write it, and only sent it at suppertime.

End: 
In fact, well after supper time. The camp-style mess hall was empty except for a few stragglers, and all that was left was a table covered with paper and a few pieces of smoked salmon, which I put on a hot dog bun - the salmon didn't fit, and stuck out absurdly. I topped it with mustard and ketchup - even though, in the dream, I thought Tarter sauce would have made more sense - and I sat down to eat.

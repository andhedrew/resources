Art is unbreakibly bound to time and place. Thus, veiwing art gives us very little guidence on how to make art - since making art is about where we are now.

Art created by others is youors to experience - but no yours to make.

You must dispell the feeling that you must create work that looks like "that" work. "that" work is not yours to create.

There is a difference between meaning that is embodied, and meaning that is referenced. No one can borrow power from accross space and time.

If you're struggling to make work, you might have drifted into new systems that don't work. Return to the structure you used when last you were happy with the art.

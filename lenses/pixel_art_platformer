// Do you need to start with two values? Where are the dark areas? Where are the light?
// How are your large shapes communicating the story? Do you need to move characters closer to the camera to induce empathy in the viewer? 
//     Make characters less stable and off-balance? Or more stable and strong? Do you need to make the world bigger and scarier, swallowing the character up? 
// Is there a clear focal point? Make sure there's a clear focal point, even at this stage.
// Start with a Primary and secondary color and an accent color.
// Where's the emphasis? Player character. Put your leading color there. Have a plan.

// To make colors pop, you don't necessrily need more saturation or bright colors, you need more contrast.
// What are your colors saying?

// Do you need to make it smaller? Keep it small, just plan the composition, no detail now. Four tiles, player, enemy, and a background are the minimal viable mockup.
// What's the core emotion you're evoking? How does the art reinforce the core emotion? Is there anything you can add to reinforce that?
// If you don't have a mid-ground or a background, try adding one. Start with simple shapes.
// Make the colors of your background elements a little bit more like your sky color to make them push back in space.
// Flip the piece horizontal, you'll catch more awkward shapes that way. then flip it back.
// Try adding contrast where you want the player to look.
// Try adding saturation where you want the player to look.
// Try subtracting colors using this tool: https://onlinepngtools.com/decrease-png-color-count
// Try changing the overall shape of the characters to match their personality. Round characters are welcoming, friendly, weak, pliable. 
//    Triangles are stable and dynamic (and risky when balanced on their point). Squares are stolid and reliable. Draw the shape first, how does the shape make you feel?
// Try adding a lot of detail.
// Try removing detail.
// Try making the foreground hot colors, the mid-ground and background cool colors.
// Try making the foreground higher contrast, the background lower contrast.
// Try adding detail to the foreground and removing detail from the background.
// Try adding little bits of color where that color doesn't exist : red details on the blue building, blue details on the red character.
// Try adding a white shine on eyes to bring them alive. 
// Try adding more darkness around the eyes to make the shine pop.
// Pay attention to hips and shoulders - make sure they're not parallel, unless they really need to be. 
// Try adding highlights to anything that you want to focus on, and removing them or de-empasizing them elsewhere.
// Think about lighting, is it consistent above all objects?
// Try adding black or dark brown shadows on every object to emphasize their seperate quality, and their physical shape.
// Do you have a clear shilouette? Fill in your character black, is it a distinctive shape? Are all your character's shapes different?
// Do they have an identifiable shape on the head?
// Character may be generic at this point, so figure out what the character is about and EMPHASIZE IT. There may be multiple things you want to emphasize, so pick one, give it a megaphone, and do another set of iterations.
// Think about the physical shape of everything, is the lighting telling the story of the shape?
// Try outlining everything with a black outline, or coloring the outline, or try removing all outlines. 
// Are you following the rule of odds? Odd numbers of items are more appealing than even.
// Try adding detailed highlights on materials to tell the story of their texture. Highlights are where we get most of our textural information. 
//    Pay attention to what "story" your terminator (area where your highlight turns to shadow) and your spectular (absolute brightest highlight) are telling about the surface.
// Try clustering objects together, and leave spaces between the clusters, instead of spacing things out.
// Do you need to give a feeling of distance? Use *Repoussoir* - An object placed in the foreground to enhance impression of 	distance. 
// Do you need to "flag" the head of characters with a light/white shape or with a bright color, or with extra detail?
// Make areas where the player need to walk safe, clear, calm, and horizontal.
// Try adding detail, darkness, texture, and sharp shapes where the player's not supposed to walk.
// Do you need exciting, kenetic, energetic, aspiring tones? Add verttical shapes that rebel against gravity.
// Do you need regal stability? Add a horizontal at the top of vertical. Controlled, stable energy.
// Do you need dynamic action or motion or tension? Add diagonals.
// Do you need Instability? Fear, floating? Upside down triangle.
// Do you need repitition to solidly imply space and depth? Shapes going up in space will reduce in a regular geometic prograssion, each space between being one-half or one-third smaller than the previous.
// Need to make something scary? Add pointy shapes.
// Need to make something stable or comforting? Add round shapes.
// Need to make an element strong? Make it bigger. If it needs to be VERY strong, make it VERY big.
// Need to tie something together, or seperate two elements? We associate same or similar colors more than same or similar shapes. 
//    This can be a positive assciation (girl and her mother are both wearing green) or negitive (the bear's eye is red and the girl's dress is red because he's looking at her).
// Need an extreme, threatenening, or confusing feeling? Regularity and irregularity are powerful, in extremes they can be very threatening.
// Do you need more contrast? We notice contrast - actually, constrast allows us to see.
// Have you looked at your white space? The picture is determined as much by the shapes in between as the shapes themselves. Color in the foreground and the background, push the shapes to be more interesting, redraw.
// Do you want to evoke a feeling of being hemmed in, calotriphobia, trapped? Reduce the space.
// Do you have strongest contrast at the focal point?
// Do you need to remove even more detail to see the composition/shape of the level more clearly?
// Do you need more shape contrast? Value contrast? Color contrast?
// Do you need more "musicality" - variation and scattering of certain elements mixed in with "silence"?
// Do I need to add life and movement? Add a cloud of butterflys, or sky whales, or something?
//Look at the image from a distance. Consider the dark shapes as holes instead of objects. Is the white space interesting and dynamic? Rearrange and redraw.
// Look at the image from a distance. Consider the dark shapes as rocks, and the white space as a river. Is water flowing through the river well?  Rearrange and redraw.
// Are you paying attention to your light source? Is every element lit in the same way, or are you falling into bad lighting habits?
// Is your lighting accurate? If the light is hitting the object at a 45* angle, 
//    then the edge closest to the player should be brightest, and the top and front planes should be lit similarly (although adjusted in color for reflected light-  off the grass, for example).
// Do you have color variation? Temparature variation? Value variation? Textural variation? Variation within the same-colored objects?
// Are all your surfaces clear and bouncing light accurately? Mirror-like surfaces are smooth and bounce light accurately. Matte surfaces are matte because they're rough, and bounce light unevenly, only reflecting some back to our eye.
// Do you need to unify the colors? Fill a layer with color, set it to the "color" blending mode, and dial up the opacity until the colors unify.
// Do you need more harmony? Try to get the colors to interact, to "kiss". Bring some of one color into another. Desaturate to help them play better together. Build bridges between colors. Find a way to distribute a color throughout the piece, instead of just having it in one place.
//Need to create a color bridge to unify a complex palette? Draw a line (curved is fine) along the color palette, and pick colors along this line. This will create structure, a bridge of colors connecting the two most contrasted colors. 
//     Feel free to add a "special" color, an accent color, that breask out of the bridge - just make sure that it's on an area of focus, and intigrate it in some way to the rest of the piece.
// Do you need more of one color in another color? Rembember the yin/yang principle - a small dot of one color in an area dominated by another color.
// Do you need to add A bit of cool color to warm colors? Warm color to cool colors? Light to your shadows? 
// Anything unclear or ambiguous? Think about the player seeing it for the first time, have you rendered everything so it's really clear at a glance what it is?

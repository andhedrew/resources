## Script Writing Lenses

# Draft

What exactly grabbed you about this story? What did you fall in love with? Boil it down to one sentance.

Steal a classic story and make it your own.

They're people, not characters.

Cover the canvas. Get the whole story down without thinking too much.

Don't prostitute your people. They should have opinions, but they shouldn't be your opinions. They should have prejudices, but not yours. Don't make them mouthpieces for your ideology or your opinions. Let them speak for themselves.

Where do you put the "camera"? Whose point of view are you using? Do you need an innocent, someone to view the events from the outside?

First rule of vocabulary: Use the first word that comes to mind, if it's colorful and appropriate.



# Rewrite

Write with the door closed, re-write with the door open.

Remove everything that isn't the story.

What's the theme? What's the theme? What's the theme?

You should have a better idea of what the script is about now.

*“I’m going to teach you had to do a full production re-write.” He took a piece of paper and wrote “Page 99” at the top. Then he wrote “The End” at the bottom. “You write a script front to back but you re-write it back to front.” And he proceeds to furiously scrawl the key plot events in reverse order. “If it’s not directly tied to these things, it goes.”* https://stevenpressfield.com/2021/05/francis-ford-coppola-on-re-writing/

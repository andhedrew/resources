##### IMPORTANT: Draw only what you enjoy. If you find yourself just dragging through a drawing, either you're tired (take a break) or you're not drawing things you enjoy. If you enjoy the drawing, others will, too. If you draw as if it's a chore, the work will be as a chore to those who see it.

# Pre-Prep Phase

## Pondering

For bigger projects, spend uninterrupted time (more than 30 minutes, 90 minutes is optimal) with just a notebook, thinking about the problem and sketching out ideas.

## Loosen up

Doodle, draw from life, combine things, play.

## Purpose/subject matter lenses

What's the theme, in a sentence?

What's the core emotion, in a word?

What is the purpose of this image?

Where is it located? Is there anything special or distinctive about the location?

What about the time period?

What emotion do you want the viewer to feel? What do you need to add to reinforce that emotion, and tell the story?

What one-sentence story do you want to tell with the image?

If a viewer were to describe the scene to a friend, what would you want them to describe?

What kind of color and lighting tells the story best?

Is this a piece that I'm going to finish? If I start, am I willing to put in a lot more hours than I think making it something good and worthwhile? 

Is there a small detail or intriguing story that you can tell with the piece? Can you make the viewer long to visit the place, to learn more about it?

# Preparation Phase



## Thumbnail Sketch Lenses

*Get through the bad/obvious ideas and down to the good ones.Your first few will probably be bad and obvious, be forewarned.*

*Experiment with shape, not necessarily form yet.*



Do you need to make it smaller? Keep it small, just plan the composition, no detail now.

Are you getting locked into one sketch too quickly? Keep restless, speed-date, try many things quite quickly at this stage.

Do you need to flip through your sketchbook for ideas or details?

🎨 Do you need to think about horizon line/eyeline? Dutch Tilt?

How does the composition reinforce the core emotion? How does it tell the story?

Do you need to apply the rule of thirds, the golden ratio, pyramid, or other compositional format?

Do you need to think about micro-compositions within the piece? Small/medium/large, elements, etc.

Are you following the rule of odds? Odd numbers of items > even.

Do you have visual balance? Is there too much light or focus on one side of the piece?

🎨 Do you have a foreground/mid-ground/background?

Are the forms clear? Do you need fill light to "tell the story" of the forms better, to highlight surface detail?

Choose a lighting scheme/schemes: Back/Rim light? Key light? Frontal light? Diffuse light? 3-quarter light? Bottom light? Dappled light?

🎮 Is your lighting telling a story larger than what's on the screen? A story of trees above, or clouds, or...?

🎨 Main light/fill light (lights shadows)/rim light together works.

Where do you want the light to direct focus?



### Composition Lenses

Skim in visual file for good ideas that you've filed and forgotten about.

Do you need reference for mood? Light? Clothing? Character? Color?

🎨 Do you need any "spokewheeling" - having lines point at the main focus of the piece?

Do you need any clustering - tight groups of subjects interspersed with empty areas? Contrast in figure placement is important, too!

🎨 Do you need to "flag" the head of characters with a light/white shape behind them?

Do you need to give a feeling of distance? Use *Repoussoir* - An object placed in the foreground to enhance impression of 	distance. 

Are you trying to make a safe, calm, stable piece? Smooth, flat, horitzontal shapes give us a sense of stability and calm. Characters wide at the bottom feel stable and reliable. A triangle on a flat base is also stable.

Do you need tto convey a sense of safety or danger? White/light backgrounds are safer than dark backgrounds.

Do you need an "island of calm" where the only horizontal elements reside, to communicate safety?

Do you need exciting, kenetic, energetic, aspiring tones? Add verttical shapes that rebel against gravity.

Do you need regal stability? Add a horizontal at the top of vertical. Controlled, stable energy.

Do you need dynamic action or motion or tension? Diagonals.

Do you need Instability? Fear, floating? Upside down triangle.

Do you need repitition to solidly imply space and depth? Shapes going up in space will reduce in a regular geometic prograssion, each space between being one-half or one-third smaller than the previous.

🎨 Do you need etherial/spiritual/freedom/happiness/power feelings? Pictures are often "read" as if there's a horizon line across the page. Place elements in the top half to embue them with these feelings.

🎨 Do you need an element to be threatened, heavier, saddened, or restrained (or grounded)? Place it in the bottom half of the screen.

🎨 Need one object to be more important? Place it higher up on the page.

Want the picture to feel more dynamic? Shift the focus to the side.

Need to make something scary? Add pointy shapes.

Need to make something stable or comforting? Add round shapes.

Need to make an element strong? Make it bigger. If it needs to be VERY strong, make it VERY big.

Need to tie something together, or seperate two elements? We associate same or similar colors more than same or similar shapes. This can be a positive assciation (girl and her mother are both wearing green) or negitive (the bear's eye is red and the girl's dress is red because he's looking at her).

Need an extreme, threatenening, or confusing feeling? Regularity and irregularity are powerful, in extremes they can be very threatening.
 
Do you need more contrast? We notice contrast - actually, constrast allows us to see.

Have you looked at your white space? The picture is determined as much by the shapes in between as the shapes themselves.

Do you need an object/focal point for the eyes to fix upon? A focal point draws us into the picture and the world, instead of staying "outside" the picture, disconnected.

Do you need to overlap multiple elements to "tie" them together into one?

Do you want to evoke a feeling of being hemmed in, calotriphobia, trapped? Reduce the space.

Are a majority of the lines in the piece pointing at the focal point, or is your attention directed elsewhere?

Do you have strongest contrast at the focal point?

Do you need to remove even more detail to see the composition more clearly?

Do you need more shape contrast? Value contrast? Color contrast?

Do you need more "musicality" - variation and scattering of certain elements mixed in with "silence"?

Do you need to look at the "line" of the piece, and reinforce that?

Do I need to add life and movement? Add a cloud of butterflys, or sky whales, or something?

#### Notan
Look at the image from a distance. Consider the dark shapes as holes instead of objects. Is the white space interesting and dynamic? Rearrange.
Look at the image from a distance. Consider the dark shapes as rocks, and the shite sppace as a river. Is water flowing through the river well?


### Storyboard Lenses

🎮 Still keep very small!

🎮 Look at contrast - how does one area affect the adjacent areas? Pump up the contrast to "sell" the story behind the area. If it's supposed to be a dark area, have it follow a light and cheery area.

## Value Comp Lenses

*Our eye doesn't see color first, it sees value first.*



Do you need to start with two values? Where are the dark areas? Where are the light?

Do you need to shapeweld - combine adjacent shapes of similar value or color? This will simplfy your composition.

Do you need more contrast? find black point/white point by holding "alt" while adjusting the arrows on either end of the curves adjustment layer

Is the core feeling clear? The core feeling should be fairly clear, even at this stage.

Are your values consistent with the light and the material? We are seeing values created by the local color+ the light.

Is there a clear focal point? Make sure there's a clear focal point, even at this stage. Focal points are for ranking information - have a primary, seconday, and tertiary focal point.



How are your large shapes communicating the story? Do you need to move characters closer to the camera to induce empathy in the viewer? Make characters less stable and off-balance? Or more stable and strong? Do you need to make the world bigger and scarier, swallowing the character up? 

Do you need some diagonals? Long parallel lines are stable, throw in some diagonals to increase threat, movement, or tension.

Pay attention to the shapes created by the value in the piece. Are they interesting and dynamic? Do they tell the story or sell the emotion well?

## Color Experiment Lenses

Are you getting too detailed? Feel free to keep the color experiements abstract, small, and rough. Play.

Have your favorite music playing, be driven by intuition, not rationalism.

## Color Lenses

Do you need to have a cool piece with a warm focal point? Warm piece with cool focal point? Flip-flop between warm and cool for different "layers" of the piece?

Have you tried communicating the opposite emotion, just using colors? Could trying the opposite emotion give you a better idea of how to communicate the core emotion?

Get and use color reference - color in real life is more interesting, subtle, and complex than what's in your head.

Do you need to color a greyscale image? Create a layer with the "color" blending mode, clip it to the layer below. 

Don't be afraid to use a brush set to color dodge (low opacity) to pump up light.

Flatten the layer and create new layers as needed.

Pay attention to light while you do your color comps.

Light: Blue sky is like a bowl-shaped, diffused light.

Do you need a gamut mask? Could you get better results with a more limited color palette?

Where's the emphasis? Put your leading color there. Have a plan.

Pick a leading color to be most saturated, desaturate the others a bit. Or a lot.

Grays communicate with each other more than saturated colors. Do you need to desaturate your colors to make the piece more cohesive?

To make colors pop, you don't need more saturation, you need more contrast.

Colors are relative— A shade appears red when it’s “redder” than its neighbor, and bright when it’s brighter than its neighbor.

Local color = “the color that the object would have in a perfect light”, or 100% light. 

If you have lighting that you like, add a curves adjustment layer with a clipping mask, and mke variations using curves.

Do you need to recolor a value comp? Create a hue/saturation layer set to "colorize" with the area masked. Then you're able to toggle it on and off to insure that you're keeping your values the same.

We associate connected colors. How can you tie elements together with similar colors? Are you accidentally ascociating two elements that shouldn't be?

### Color meanings/themes

*These are not absolutes! No universal color definition, feel free to break the rules if need be.*

#### Red

Love, passion, violence, danger, anger, power

### Pink

Innocence, sweetness, fimininity, playfulness, empathy, beauty

### Orange

Warmth, sociability, friendliness, happiness, exotic, youthfulness

### Yellow

Madness, sickness, insecurity, obsessiveness, idyllic, naiveté.

### Green

Nature, immuaturity, corruption, ominous, darkness, danger.

### Blue

Coldness, isolation, cerebral, meloncholy, passivity, calmness.

### Purple

Fantasy, etherial, erotic, illusory, mystical, ominous.

### Creating a color palette?

Start with a Primary and secondary color and an accent color.

Make sure you have enough contrast by making it black and white. Do you have a dark color? Light color?

Pick your core color, and make a dark version of it. Take the lightest color and make a really much lighter version.

Unify the palette by adding a color layer above, and gradually turn up the opacity until all the colors play nicely together.

Test our your colors against each other. Put your darkest color under the palette. Put your lightest color under the palette. Tweak and adjust if anything looks off.

If you're adding a new color, test it out on top of the color you're adjusting. Look at the color in context, not by itself.

Can you add a near opposite on the color wheel to the palette?



## Clean-up/Line Drawing Sketch Lenses

Flatten chosen thumbnail, increase it in size to maximum dimension you need.

Do you need to try a different appproach? Things don't always come together right away! If it's not quite right, experimenting at this stage is cheaper than changiing later.

Do line work, add detail so that you know what to paint

Think of it as thumbnail 2.0. You can always re-work it.

🎨 Do you need to consider your eye-level? Be sure your eye-level is clear, even if there's no horizon.

🎨 Do you need a perspective grid?

Are your silhouettes clear and distinctive?

### Character

What kind of character? give them a story and and emotion.

Are there other characters in the scene? What relationship do they have with the main character? How can you add additional conflict or cues to the nature of their relationship?

Does each character have a clear, dynamic "line of action"? I.E. is there a single line that you can draw from their head to their feet, and is it a dynamic line?



## Reference Collection Lenses

Do you need to make a 3D model to reference?

What feeling do you want to evoke with this piece? Google that feeling at look at what works make you feel that feeling. Why?

Do you need to start with the familiar? Take apart objects you know to build something new.

Do you need to exaggerate something normal to make it fantastic?

Is there any details you can add to make the piece feel more "lived-in" and real? What about a history, and a sense of time?

### Do you need color reference?

# Execution Phase

*Enter when you've got a solid thumbnail, color experiments, and values study.*

*Do you need an arbitraty layer of colors on the canvas to paint over? This can often lead to happy accidents later on.*

## Line drawing Lenses

🎮 Do you need perspective lines?

🎮 Do you need a vanishing point reference?  You can make each item have its own vanishing point, just make sure they have consitently distant vanishing points (each one has a 500 px vanishing point, for instance)

🎮 Do you need a character size reference?

🎮 Do you need to push the 3-dimensionality of the objects more with the lines? No flat stickers!

🎮 Do you have a clear change of planes on each object? A clear point where the top plane becomes the side plane? If it's a complex or rounded object, make sure you determine where the object will be brightest, and make sure that the top and sides of the object are still clearly diliniated. 

🎮 Are you lighting from the top-right hand corner? Did you mean to, or are you lazy-lighting?

🎮 Do you need to draw out the footprint of the object first?

### Block up/flats

Have a small version of color key on the canvas to sample from.

Do you need to seperate and colororground/mid/background?  Do you need to seperate out any areas of focus and characters?

Get the local color in. (Local color = “the color that the object would have in a perfect light”, or 100% light. )

### Light and Shadow

Light makes an object as bright as it can be, but no brighter. An orange pumpkin doesn’t become white in light—it can’t get any brighter than 100% orange.

Are you paying attention to your light source? Is every element lit in the same way, or are you falling into bad lighting habits?

Do you need to use screen/multiply clipping layers to paint in shadow and light?

Do you need to mask in lighting? Create a layer filled with light color, set to overlay, and mask in lighting with a soft brush.

Do you need to get more lighting reference?

Do you need to add a white layer (set to color blending mode) over the whole peice to look at the light and the value without the distraction of color?

Turn the piece to black-and-white (white filled layer set to "color" blending mode) and squint your eyes. Are the values of each area distinct, or are areas blending together with others?

## Rendering Lenses

Do you want to flatten lines down? Tint them roughly as dark as the darkest color on the canvas, and merge them down. Start painting them out.

Do you need to seperate different elements onto their own layers?

Just starting? Solve the most difficult parts first. Try to paint the background before the foreground.

Are you getting too dark/too light too quickly? Add the punch at the end.

Do you need a reference point for where your light is coming from?

Do you have enough contrast, and enough different kinds of contrast? Are they highest at the focal point Contrast of value, color, detail, hard lines, everything should be highest at the focal point.

🎮  Is your lighting accurate? If the light is hitting the object at a 45* angle, then the edge closest to the player should be brightest, and the top and front planes should be lit similarly (although adjusted in color for reflected light-  off the grass, for example).

🎨 What edges do you need to accentuate, and what edges do you need to lose in the shadow?

🎨 Do you have too many sharp edges? Soften any edge that doesn't need to be sharp.

Need more color variety? Look for excuses to add color variety and texture. There's endless variation in nature, emulate that.

Do you want to play with optical grey? Take the color in question and generate two new colors, each one equally removed from the main color. Use these two colors together to generate the main color. It will appear the same color, but have much more visual interest. Just make sure they have the same value.

Do you have color variation? Temparature variation? Value variation? Textural variation? Variation within the same-colored objects?

Do you need to draw more attention to the focus? Add the concentrated extremes of the color range you've chosen.

Are you over-saturating? Saturation is a contrast tool, use it that way.

Are all your surfaces clear and bouncing light accurately? Mirror-like surfaces are smooth and bounce light accurately. Matte surfaces are matte because they're rough, and bounce light unevenly, only reflecting some back to our eye. 

Is your lighting an accurate reflection of the environment? Lighting is a very blurred reflection of the environment - What we know as lighting is simply a blurred reflection of everything surrounding the object. Divide the surface of an object into the texture and the light behavior on the material. One is local color, the other is how the surface reacts to the light based on how smooth or rough it is.

Do you have a diffuse light?? If the light is indirect light (passed through a cloud, for example) it's scattered and diffuse and will bleed into the shadows and light more of the area than direct light.

Are all of your surfaces reflecting light properly? Think about how light bounces back and forth between surfaces, losing some energy each time. It also picks up colors from each surface. 

Pay attention to what "story" your terminator (area where your highlight turns to shadow) and your spectular (absolute brightest highlight) are telling about the surface.

Some services have shine, like a thin, transparent covering. This is the only place where you should lower saturation to make local color brighter than its natural value limit.

Highlights tell the story of the surface, do you need more detail in highlights? Shadowy areas can remain reletively undetailed.

What about interaction of colors? Is there any bounced light that needs to be painted in?

Does anything unnaturally stick out? Do you need to content-aware healing brush any weird spots?

Any highlights that need punching? Think about the surfaces you're communicating. Can you make the texture and surface clearer with highlights?

Where's the focal point? Can you increase the contrast, add a pop of white or the main color to draw attention to the focal point?



Do you need chromaic aberration? It gets stronger the farther from the center of the lens you are. Enhances a sence of depth. Duplicate a later, double-click one copy and turn off the red channel, double click the other copy and turn off the green and blue channels (or whatever combination you want for the effect you're making) Subtly shift one layer over to make chromatic aberration.

Do you need to copy merge to get a flat version? Make some changes to the flat version, mask some parts out, copy-merge again if you want.

Do you have enough detail in the light areas of the piece, or is the detail blown-out by too much brightness, and needs to be brought back in?

When you're close to done, consider an airbrush with color dodge set to push the lights, bring in extra color to highlights. Select a bright color and paint in the clow on the copy-marked layer.



### Do you need more color harmony?

Do you need to unify the colors? Fill a layer with color, set it to the "color" blending mode, and dial up the opacity until the colors unify.

Do you need more interaction between dark and light? Contrasting colors? Shapes?

Do you need more harmony? Try to get the colors to interact, to "kiss". Bring some of one color into another. Desaturate to help them play better together. Build bridges between colors. Find a way to distribute a color throughout the piece, instead of just having it in one place.

Need to create a color bridge to unify a complex palette? Draw a line (curved is fine) along the color palette, and pick colors along this line. This will create structure, a bridge of colors connecting the two most contrasted colors. Feel free to add a "special" color, an accent color, that breask out of the bridge - just make sure that it's on an area of focus, and intigrate it in some way to the rest of the piece.

### Rembember the "yin/yang principle"

Do you need more of one color in another color? Rembember the yin/yang principle - a small dot of one color in an area dominated by another color.

Do you need to add A bit of cool color to warm colors? Warm color to cool colors? Light to your shadows? 

Use a saturation layer and target certain colors to adjust and refine! You can also check to see if it's too monochromatic - if one channel changes most of the piece, that may be a red flag!

## Post-processing Lenses

Do you need to add a dark/light "punch" to increase contrast?

🎨 Flatten your image

If you want to experiment with some changes, copy the flattened layer and make the changes, then compare with the original and save the better version.

A curves adjustment layer can add a LOT of color complexity and beauty to individual elements, or the whole piece.

Do you need more saturation? Or less? Or change it in some areas to increease contrast or focus on the main focal point?

Do I need to darken/lighten to increase contrast or variation?


Do you need to re-color anything? Create a hue/saturation layer and mask it.

Do you need to use soft light/color dodge/multiply soft brushes to add pops of color or color tints? Play around, it can lead to lovely polished effect. Pump up light and shadow subtlely, add color complexity.

Do you need more color variation? soft light brush or color brush, color pick from the drawing and add complexity and variation to other areas

Do you need a fill light layer set to multiply?

Do you need to add depth of field? Light beams? Punch up colors? Deepen shadows? Does it need to be in a particular aspect ratio?

Do you want more color complexity? Pull up color balance, and play with colors in shadows, mid-tones, and highlights.

Do you need an old/decrepit effect? Copy the lines, set the threshold pretty low, and color the layer red to add a messy, rusty effect to the lines.

Do you need to add a film/photographic feel to the image? Create a 50 neutral grey layer, and set to overlay. Add noise.

Try sharpening the artwork. Copy the whole drawing to a new layer, and filter>other>high pass (10 pixels). Set that layer to soft light, or other blending mode.

Anything unclear or ambiguous?

Anything crooked? Use liquify to fix oddy angled things.

Anything too small/too big? Use liquify to adjust.

## Character Design Lenses

Do you have a clear line of action?

Pay attention to hips and shoulders - make sure they're not parallel, unless they really need to be.

You can also knees, eyes, elbows, hands, as rhythm lines.

^The more angles you can create between these lines, the more dynamic your character will appear.



Weight: The hip that's higher is holding most of the weight.

The foot holding the weight will usually be in a straight line with the head, right underneith.

Do you have a clear shilouette?

Do you have an identifiable shape on the head?

Concept possibilities (describe different ways it could go. 1,2,3,4…):

Character design:

Draw a basic body and copy it several times

Sketch variations over the body. Aim for variation of shapes, shilouette, and symmatry. Consider history, location, and consider following visual pattern/methodology.

Choose the best design,do studies of real-world objects to inform the design.

Refine with kowlege of real-world elements. Good design is often just reality with a twist.

Character may be generic at this point, so figure out what the character is about and EMPHASIZE IT. There may be multiple things you want to emphasize, so pick one, give it a megaphone, and do another set of iterations.

Once it feels more specific and unique, do at least three color studies.
